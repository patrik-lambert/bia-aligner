Europe is at a crossroads , and we must demonstrate to all the Member States that it will be in their interests to be inside , rather than outside , the monetary union .
Since the adoption of the PEPPER report last January financial participation has , amongst many other topics , been discussed in the context of the Green Paper on partnership for a new organization of work .
The Union is , and should remain , a union of States .
I find no trace of any serious reprimand for the three Commissioners responsible , making it clear that they were in breach of their supervisory responsibilities and of their duty of care .
There is , of course , the possibility that some people here might prefer to continue working with nebulous data in order to conceal their countrys true financial position .
I have to say , on behalf of my group where we have debated the issue at length that our positive attitude towards Turkey is unanimous .
I have been listening very carefully to this debate .
Finally , I must ask the Commissioner present today , because I have asked this repeatedly , to express , in this plenary session , an effective commitment to this Parliament for the presentation of an offprint to the regulation in relation to the registers and calculation of VAT own resources , because I must remind you the approval of the joint position was , in my view , linked to this commitment .
A report of those meetings , in which a detailed analysis of the situation is provided , has been presented to the Scientific Steering Committee . This committee met in Brussels yesterday and is meeting today in order to discuss and draft an opinion on this matter .
These amendments advocate better quality health services , security and solidarity , and propose new means of financing statutory retirement schemes with a view in particular to extending social welfare contributions to all income , at a rate identical to that levied on wages and salaries .
Mr President , I wish to protest again this year that the amendment tabled by my delegation on the 2005 calendar , which seeks to end this charade of coming to Strasbourg every month at gross expense to the European Union taxpayer , has been declared inadmissible .
This responds to one of the requests made to the Commission in the Howitt report on the Green Paper .
We have received encouraging signals from the field .
If these were adjusted using the level of prices in the different countries the differences between regions and countries would be considerably reduced .
It was an animated , very convivial game .
I am really quite amazed that the Councils Budget Committee has already proposed more far-reaching savings in the agricultural sector than the Commission , notably to the tune of half a billion euros .
The report arrives at - and I quote - a ' definitely positive verdict regarding the implementation to date of the Structural Fund programmes in the three Member States ' .
For this reason , Mr Bardong 's report and the Commission 's proposal are to be strongly supported .
The other thing I would like to take up is the experience from the Schengen Agreement which has a similar structure to the Eurodac system .
I recall that the on 13 July the Council urged General Abubakar to release all the remaining detainees and to clarify his plans for future elections .
I believe we should achieve this in time .
To take account of this vast , tragic situation is the most urgent task confronting all the nations of Europe .
I understand Mr von Boetticher 's problem and even agree with his comment about the difficulties .
I agree with the words of the President of the European Parliament Madame Nicole Fontaine according to whom we can not continue building the European Union in " closed circles " .
Ojala ( GUE / NGL ) . - ( FI ) Mr President , now that I have heard Commissioner Flynn 's standpoint , I should like to state that I recommended the adoption of the amendments in question and that the recommendation concerning Amendment 11 , to which I intended to make an oral amendment for 1999 , is now superfluous .
I wish to say that this refers to a great many people with European passports , including women and children , Italians , Greeks and other nationals of the European Union who have married Palestinians .
I believe that these twin developments are worrying and that we can not accept reforms on the cheap .
I am in favour of this and support the demand that the Commission should draw up a precise and rigorous timetable for this .
Outside the refugee camps , there are so-called travel agents waiting who send refugees with money on to other countries , and the cheapest fare to a Western country is now a journey to Australia , which costs approximately EUR 6 000 .
What those of us in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proposed was simply that Parliaments role should be established in the light of this method .
In other words , it is for us to define the new financial framework within the context and objective of stabilization of Community expenditure , which can be translated as : in line with the balancing of national budgets .
I , too , want to wish him well in the work he is going to do for us in the European Union over the next six months .
It is a meagre amount : EUR 3.3 billion from 1995 to 1999 , from Morocco to Gaza and the West Bank , even if , by adding to it the EUR 3.6 million in loans from the European Investment Bank , the financial contribution is greater than the EUR 4.4 billion given by the World Bank .
Our answer to both questions is no ' .
So we hope that the lack of understanding and the resulting lack of support in the future will give rise to far fewer problems in terms of , say , recognition of examination certificates and hence the true freedom of movement of labour .
If we adopt this report we can start to establish minimum basic rights , as the Minister and the Commissioner have said , for refugees , for access to welfare , housing , education , health care things that we in the privileged world take for granted .
The fact that the EU accepts the Petersberg undertakings , peace-keeping and peace-making missions in other words , is positive .
As one possible candidate for President of Chechnya said to me , money creates peace .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I have read and re-read the Commissions document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office .
Moving on to Amendments Nos 4 to 8 and 12 , which are linked to the reform of the economic conditions under the customs regimes , the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 6 and 12 , but can not set aside its proposal , as required under Amendment No 4 . The Commission can , however , clarify the wording of its initial proposal .
We therefore rejected the amendments seeking to remove from the scope of this directive control over the maximum weekly working time , night working hours , weekly rest periods and driving times between these rest periods and a two-weekly limitation of driving hours as proposed by the Commission in Annex 1 .

However , values should not just be described ; justice , the fight against poverty and peace must be pursued in difficult circumstances .
Just a few more words about export issues .
Giving up the use of nuclear power may be a subject for populists in the developed countries of Europe , or here in Parliament , where it really is a populist subject , but the realistic alternative is nowhere else to be found , not even in those countries the Union is going to embrace in the future .
The increase in intergovernmental initiatives , the official demands raised , and the options discussed in connection with enhanced cooperation , are all initiatives that could ruin the truly successful nature of the European Union .
Sixthly : hygiene .
That , incidentally , shows that the relationship between the national parliaments and the European Parliament is much better than many people think , and that is a good thing , because we have many common interests .
The EU must allocate more resources particularly for the naval services in those countries in the short-term .
Certain tasks should be performed at EU level , in order to support , complement or coordinate the work of national authorities .
I think something needs to change there .
Turkey will have no choice but to make drastic changes and make steps towards the European Union . There is as yet no evidence of such steps being made .
These negotiations are certainly more than crucial for Europe .
Therefore , once again , we want to roundly condemn the Taliban regime .
It is significant that the provisions of Article 8 b ( 2 ) expressly state that the political rights covered by it are without prejudice to Article 138 ( 3 ) and the provisions adopted for its implementation .
The Council has to a large extent given in to American pressure , and I want , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , to call upon the national parliaments in the EU and in the candidate countries to keep a close eye on what their governments are doing so that the Rome Statute is not weakened .
We obviously think that it is possible to contribute to the funding of peace observers and human rights monitors as an important measure in the scope of the peace process .
Jean-Marie Le Pen intended to open Pandora 's box , in an attempt to let out the old demons of our common past ; but he has made an error which could cost him dear .
I therefore appeal to you to decisively reject Amendment No 147 .
Depleted uranium particles , once lodged inside an organism , may cause severe damage to the health not only of military personnel but of civilians as well .
Of course , it is said that no real decentralization has occurred , only a deconcentration .
In my answer , I gave an example of events in actual fact taking the opposite course .
Diesel vehicles consume less fuel and produce fewer carbon dioxide emissions .
- ( FI ) Mr President , the Commission 's announcement on the promotion of a combined heat and power industry in the EU area is an important step forward for energy policy .
I think we should give Mr Laschets report our full backing and vote unanimously in favour of it .
Secondly , the same European rules should apply to public service broadcasting and to commercial stations offering capacity for public services .
We might even ask ourselves whether this inertia does not derive from the fact that the majority of mobile phone manufacturers are European companies .
In particular the preparation for citizens and companies is essential .
So , while it is certainly useful to have a network which enables those who wish to find a job in another country within the European Union , our first priority must continue to be to make it possible for businesses to create jobs for their own people in their own countries .
Clearly there is pressure on our agenda today .
Furthermore , although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme , the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed .
While today President Santer and I have been focusing on the employment guidelines , we also approved two other documents .
In my view , the common position before us , which we have to decide on today , has a number of crucial weaknesses , which for the rest nobody has disputed so far during the debate in terms of principle .
However , as you know , the Commission has no authority in this matter to implement many of the measures you ask for in your resolution .
What is more , in several Member States , the authority responsible for supervising such institutions is different from the one in charge of supervising the system itself , which would lead to an artificial division of powers and create confusion .
That is why I am very grateful that our vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy was unanimous .
I consider that we have reached the point at which the system that we have had for many years has outlived its usefulness .
On the other hand , monetary policy can not bring down long term interest rates .
Europes leaders , of which you are one , are reduced to carrying out increasingly frequent operations to manipulate the media and public opinion .
He really had his hands full with one of the most difficult and important reports in this parliamentary term , and he has done an outstanding job of it .
Information on emissions into the environment must always be disclosed even in exceptional circumstances except on grounds relating to defence , safeguarding the course of justice , or industrial or intellectual property rights .
Madam President , we want action from the Commission so that we do not have to keep on asking it for the same things .
However , these consequences are also contributing , in a transitional phase , to the liberalisation and restructuring measures which , with our backing , are being implemented .
Members will recall that the European Union , as the Presidency said , is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East .
This is done with the CCEE countries and it will be necessary to do the same with this new form of cross-border cooperation .
The argument that zoos are essential to the conservation of endangered species is not borne out by experience .
It should have read : ' Save the radioactive dinosaurs from extinction ' .
All reports have their good points , and this one is no exception .
The Commission is aware that the organisation of the referendum is currently affected by problems with the finalisation of the list of voters and it hopes that Mr Bakers visit to the region will bring the desired breakthrough .
It is , of course , for efforts within the reality that we are experiencing today to ensure that we again take international initiatives .
I think it is important for us to make progress in establishing the legal bases for the proposals which are made .
Mr President , I am speaking as spokesperson for the Committee on Budgets on fisheries issues and it falls to me firstly to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Fava , whose report I am essentially going to comment on , on its excellence .
It is surely unacceptable that roads , for instance , should be built with contaminated materials .
Every wet place is affected , including , as far as Loire-Atlantique is concerned , the Brière , Brivet , Goulaine , and Redon marshes , the Grand Lieu lake , the Mazerolles plains , and so forth .
In the event that the Burmese Government does not introduce additional political changes , we will have to consider that possibility .
Well , four months have gone by and I have received no reply whatsoever .
Our American partners have indicated that given the need for continued negotiations on a number of crucial issues they think that the April deadline can not be met .
I think that the Commission needs to pay greater attention to this fact in its activities in future .
In serious cases , some countries envisage the right to asylum , as contemplated in the directive under the heading of the right to asylum for reasons of sexual discrimination .
Thank you for your statement , Commissioner .
So today I will just be bringing you up to date on the main issues under discussion .
In such cases we have emphasized the importance of the issues and have dealt with them in detail including setting out options which a view to the further work of the conference .
II . the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 91/494/ EEC on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and imports from third countries of fresh poultry meat ( COM ( 95 ) 0535 - C 40028/96 - 95/0269 ( CNS ) )
Even if it were possible to achieve that consensus on a political level , numerous technical problems would still arise , such as problems relating to the appropriate tax basis and collection mechanisms .
What crime have the employees of Metaleurope committed ?
I am aware that that is not the job of the Commission or of the Commissioner , but I should still like to ask if you , as a Commissioner , could assume a common European line during all your discussions and efforts .
Two names have been mentioned : Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mrs Lambert , sitting next to her .
Another objection was that the Inuits of Northern Canada can only live off tourism , in the style of Marie Antoinette , who suggested that the starving people of Paris should eat cake if they were unable to buy bread .
- Aelvoet recommendation ( A 4 - 0165/98 )
In my own fevered imagination , I have always equated stakeholders with Count Dracula .
Mr President , firstly , may I say to many colleagues here who are directly affected in the Limburg region , that I represent a region in the United Kingdom , the West Midlands , which has probably been more affected by structural change in the automotive industry than any other region in Europe .
There are no figures for countries like Portugal , Ireland and Greece , which want a derogation .
I note your observation .
The work that has been done in the committee and the fact that we are standing where we are today owe a very great deal to him .
. Mr President , I shall try to answer some of the points raised by Members .
Mr Martinez took part in the first one , and right here I have , if my fellow Member would care to consult it , his minority opinion , which was expressed in writing at the time of the Böge committee .
The European Union emphatically condemns slavery in all its forms , including , as the concept does today , alongside traditional slavery and the slave trade , such things as serious violations of the rights of children and of women , the exploitation of certain dependency situations , and apartheid .
Mr President , I wish to tell the House that , 10 days ago , Professor Venios Angelopoulos of the Athens Polytechnic travelled to JFK airport in the United States and disappeared . He disappeared for five hours because he was being interrogated by the FBI .
The European Union has increased its aid considerably .
In spite of the fact that we have reduced pollution and are using energy and materials more efficiently , the gains are quickly being eroded by increased growth .
Can the Commission rule this out with absolute certainty ?
It is what you would expect , and is hardly surprising .
Against the background of the European Commission 's Green Paper on the effect of traffic on the environment and the White Paper on the future development of a common transport policy , people have repeatedly explained the necessity of making the EU 's transport policy environmentally suitable .
Chechnya could have developed into a Tatarstan , and perhaps even a Tatarstan with more independence than Tatarstan itself .
In this connection , I wish to stress that the best way significantly to improve the quality of the administrative activities of Community institutions and bodies is to adopt a code of good administrative behaviour , in the same way as rules on public access to documents have been adopted by the Community institutions and bodies .
It is just that I am trying not to indulge in demagoguery .
Food is not such a simple matter .
I have already appeared before the French Senate .
If I can return again to Lithuania , one of the most spectacular events in my life was a visit to the KGB Museum in Vilnius where my blood ran cold .
In this report we are giving a political signal , telling them that we await them in the Strasbourg family .
Instead of the required answers , we have today received an explanation from the Commission which can not be the last word as far as the European Parliament is concerned .
Let me now turn to the question raised about proposals for implementing measures .
. Mr President , before proceeding with the vote let me draw Members ' attention to the following oral amendments to heading 5 .
Indeed , their vigour , their enthusiasm , and most importantly , their all-round good humour in dealing with difficult issues should be recognised .
This is a much fairer option .
Destructuring always entails costs - whether it be within the European Union or within the territories and countries with which the European Union is associated .
- Mr President , when I say that Members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection did not dwell too long on their opinion on this report , it demonstrates not a lack of interest nor an absence of strongly held , informed , scientifically backed views , but rather the commendable virtue of consistency .
The first relates to the splitting of pension rights acquired during married life in favour of women who have given up their careers to look after their families and who , in the event of divorce after 20 or more years of marriage , are particularly liable to fall below the poverty line .
Mr President , I speak in my capacity as draftsman of the opinion on the European Climate Change Programme .
Another important area of attention is the implementation of the Trans-European Networks , particularly with regard to the environmental pre-conditions within which this is supposed to take place .
This was with the intention to establish a sustainable and social market economy in the European Union .
On the outstanding areas of disagreement on the stability pact , what constitutes temporary and exceptional circumstances and the automaticity of fines for errant States , the ELDR supports the room for manoeuvre and judgment indicated by the Commission 's proposal .
However , and this is my second point , I believe we must draw a distinction between old and new cars .
In the current framework the European Commission has already undertaken a considerable number of initiatives to protect children 's rights as in the Daphne and Stop programmes which fall under my competence .
I must say that I was greatly perturbed by Mrs Frahms intervention , because she claimed that the proposals represent quite a step backwards , and that is simply not true .
Like everyone else in this House , I hope and expect that the sow stalls proposal will go through on Thursday . It will certainly have our support .
In the past , as rapporteur , Mr Lehne has already had the opportunity to show his interest , expertise and commitment in this subject that he has just presented .
As we have learned over Bosnia , we can not afford to rely on President Milosevic 's word .
That must be the basic principle .
The enlargement process must lead to the export of security and not the import of insecurity !
In one of the most delightful Member States of the European Union , exceeding the speed limit can be detected by a police officer with the naked trained eye , as it is said .
This plan offers an opportunity and should not be gambled away due to false or inadequate information .
I am only referring to your own data .
If it is established , the performance reserve - at least as it is in the Commission 's current proposal , with a figure of 10 % - will in practice be a political instrument that is unnecessary and even counterproductive .
The decision was made to move gradually to the coverage of all serious crime .
In order to move forward with the internal market , it will be necessary to insist on the principle of harmonisation .
- Madam President , I must admit I find it unusual at this stage in the budgetary procedure not to be fighting for something .
I do wish , however , to see the introduction of a maximum dose yes , a maximum dose is something I do want to see .
I therefore think that it remains very difficult to justify making such demands , entailing large additional costs for car owners .
Parliament thus does not want any extension in additives in flour-treatment agents as we feel this is unnecessary and there are already enough products .
Time and time again in Holy Scripture we are warned against what is called genetic confusion .
It is a coincidence , but perhaps a fortunate one , that this very week when we are in the last week of the life of this House , we are also in the first week of the life of the Amsterdam Treaty .
We in the Freedom Party have always declared our opposition to the transportation of live animals , especially to countries far beyond the frontiers of the EU , because of the intolerable suffering it involves for the animals , and so we regard it as our duty to demand the deletion of this passage from the Commission proposal , a point on which , unfortunately , no comment is made in Mr Alavanos 's report .
Today , with the sense of a job well done , we should look forward in hope to the future of Europe .
Our Committee on Constitutional Affairs backs what she has said and if we can do that , next year we will discuss politics more and process less .
The Commission therefore believes that it is much more logical to maintain the system as it is at the moment , with the guarantee that , without any doubt , if any candidate countries have problems , the macrofinancial aid system will be applied to them .
No , enlargement is a chance to create a common area of welfare and security in Europe , and we must seize that chance !
In other words , the Swedes have helped legitimise the Regulation rather than defending citizens interests , and today the European Parliament has followed suit .
First of all I am glad that rather than telling us about the book-keeping for the next six months you have put the decisions facing the German Presidency of the Council in the longer-term perspective of the development of the European Union .
In my view , it is obvious that there can be no sustainable development without economic and social development it is as simple as that .
We are therefore able to accept the amendments which Mr Blokland and Mr Eisma in particular underlined as important for their positions .
My thanks also go to Mr Rübig , who not only asked questions , but played a constructive role in this whole discussion .
Meanwhile , governments wishing to reduce taxes and suffering from a lack of funds have sold such companies to internationally operating concerns that wish to make a profit from them .
That is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where , in practice , there is still a monopoly , that is where the state is the only player .
The United States , which serves as your model in so many fields , should also serve as a model in matters concerning economic and monetary policy .
If someone leaves , that is nobodys fault but their own or , to quote Lenin and Gorbachev , life will punish whoever leaves early .
We are also providing it in the preparations for the negotiation of regional economic partnership agreements with our ACP partners .
Lastly , I should like to draw the Commissions attention to the difficult problem that the European Union will face in the future , which is the effective control of its external borders .
The proposal for a Council directive concerns the incineration of waste that is not covered by this directive , that is , non-hazardous waste , such as urban waste and certain other types of hazardous waste that are excluded from the scope of the previous directive .
This will inevitably be a long-term enterprise , especially in that it involves an area where the Community 's competence is limited .
No statistical data exists .
I happened to be there at the time as a member of this Parliaments delegation .
However , there is another fundamental issue that is much more difficult : how can we cooperate while preserving democracy ?
The services concerned will study this matter and I shall then give you a full answer as soon as I can .
You all have a stake in some government somewhere , on which we are not getting a return .
When you know the quality of the initiative of the Council of Europe , of which we here are the hosts , and which does a considerable body of work which has been kept under a wraps when it should have been the concern of our entire continent , all of these elements seem rather puzzling to us .
Given the current state of the labour market and the income differentials between men and women , the latter receive less unemployment benefit on average . This is in spite of the policy of equal opportunities , providing for equal pay for male and female workers , as sanctioned by Article 119 of the Maastricht Treaty , an article with which we are very familiar and have discussed several times in this House .
My Group does not merely intend that we should acquire in this way a funding channel for the European parties , but what is most important is that there will now be the opportunity to define those basic principles on which the European parties can function .
25 % of the seats in the House of the People are reserved for women , yet it remains uncertain that this provision , along with others establishing rights for women , will help to implement women 's rights properly or help women get elected in the coming election .
Furthermore , the Charter of Fundamental Rights , in Article 5 , freedom to choose an occupation , stipulates that everyone has the right to pursue a freely chosen or accepted occupation , and freedom to choose an occupation is different from free enterprise .
- ( IT ) Mr President , I wish to second Mr von Wogau 's request , since my own vote , which was against , has not been recorded .
In this regard we must thank the rapporteur , Mr Callanan , for a job well done .
My first point is about the expenditure in 2000 of the Synergy programme , which is a programme to further international cooperation in the energy sector , and one strongly supported by the European Parliament .
This applies too to the policies that we support through the Structural Funds or the funds for transport .
I also have a question about the distribution of competences .
The Commission and the Council have set themselves and Parliament the goal of creating a coherent legal framework for electronic commerce , which is intended , over the coming years , to substantially push forward the integration of Europe 's financial markets and enhance the capacity of Europe 's financial services sector to compete across the world .
The Structural Funds are currently geared to geographical ' objective regions ' , on the basis of criteria of weak development .
It was a pity that the Lisbon conclusions did not call for a timetable .
I can not see that very much in particular , or even anything at all , has happened in the five years since then .
The stakes , therefore , were very high and the consequences of not acting would have been extremely serious .
To improve the competitiveness of the coffee sector and broaden the export base in developing countries , we also need to support the full integration of commodity issues into the long-term development strategies of the developing countries .
Finally , we must not demonize any experience or initiative , whether negative or positive .
Mr President , I should like to invite the House to support the report by my colleague , Maria Carrilho , which aims at improving a regulation which we consider important .
I think it is important that , here too , Parliament is really involved in the debate on content .
Among the many interesting points put forward in Mr Hernández Mollar 's report I detected two areas on which I think he is trying to place somewhat more emphasis .
Is there any threat to the date of 1 January ?
As far as Parliament is concerned , these are not just hollow words , but words of substance .
This now also needs to be done under criminal law , at European level , in very open and clear cooperation with the Member States .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Amendments Nos 1 and 10 , which were adopted by a majority of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , relate to a ban on the use of catering waste for feeding and to its disposal and use .
The second is clearly the climatic consequences of energy .
I believe this agreement can make a considerable contribution to the processes of modernization and economic development to which the Republic of Yemen has committed itself .
We know , however , that the framework agreement between six EU States to promote the defence of industry and of a global defence market is precisely the most opaque procedure ever , that it clasps tightly what it used to give : no parliamentary scrutiny and no debate , even on the conclusion and ratification of this agreement .
That principle has been rightly secured by this judgment .
At present , there is room for considerable improvement with regard to both of these aspects .
Madam President , Commissioner , the liberal group sanctions the agreement reached on Sunday between China and the United States regarding the lowering of bilateral barriers to trade .
This was true prior to 11 September .
I have to say that I have received no representations from allergy sufferers on this point .
On the other hand , the Commission 's text suffers from an important gap concerning the case where animals are directly imported by third countries , without passing through European Union operators .
And all this may seriously delay implementation of the TACIS programme for 1996 .
- Madam President , I would like to begin my contribution by paying tribute to the many very brave men and women in Albania who have risked their lives and their livelihood in order to try to preserve peace , order and decency in that country .
It has , of course , been a widespread feature of society over the last few years that organisations have been obliged to re-think the way they organise their work in order to maintain competitiveness and exploit the opportunities offered by modern technology and public administration and , in so doing , give the electorate full value for their tax contributions .
Yet importantly , there clearly was a breach of competition rules on a massive scale .
- ( FR ) The CFSP , which was first launched by the Maastricht Treaty , has found it hard to make its mark .
I intend to bring these forward , especially since I understand this morning that the Council has decided to withdraw the regulations as presented and to present them in a new format , thereby delaying yet further the adoption of the regulations .
Over recent years the devastation caused has been immense , particularly in Venezuela .
I therefore believe that the final objective should be the establishment of a single body corresponding to a single legal framework within the European Union and that that body be provided with its own budget and staff , even exceeding the normal distribution between pillars , taking advantage of the option provided for in Article 42 of the Treaty of the European Union .
Employers should be responsible for ensuring that their employees are not harassed and that they have equal wages for equal work and the opportunity to pursue careers and , especially , to combine work and family life .
Finally , we call on the European Commission to take the necessary legislative initiatives on all the issues which touch on immigration and , of course , to define the mutual obligations as between the Member States .
In a modern democracy , a strong State must be balanced by a strong civil society .
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Antonio Guterres , and immediately give the floor to Mr Romano Prodi , President of the Commission .
So my request to you is : give human rights a chance , again by referring to them in documents and agreements .
The same mistakes are being made over and over again : whether we are talking about authorisation to import genetically modified maize from the United States or the lifting of the embargo on gelatine , suet and bovine sperm originating from Britain , they are the same procedures which are leading the Commission to substitute itself for the Council and to act to the detriment of public health and the environment in our States .
Over the next decade it is going to decline .
We are talking about an Internet world where people can shop all over the European Union and where businesses can put out offers to them .
European public opinion expects us to act quickly to stop a sequence of events that is not predestined : to end the fighting and bring aid to those who need it so much and so urgently .
I hope that the new Parliament and the new Commission will make use of them .
That is why I asked if there were any objections .
This conference should form the cornerstone of broad public debate in Europe , which should be given a structured start at this sort of conference .
We can not preach in favour of democracy and liberty if we do not set an example ourselves .
A new treaty can not be agreed unless some political flexibility enters the political process .
Right now , without any change to the Regulations , and this is the best way , EUR 1 billion in public expenditure was eligible for European aid , within the framework of the total appropriations allocated to Greece .
Rübig ( PPE ) . - ( DE ) Madam President , I wanted to inform you that 100 francs have disappeared from my petty cash .
Perhaps the Court of Justice when we bring our action and perhaps we will also claim damages .
The much trumpeted area of freedom , security and justice is nothing more than the confirmation of a bureaucratic , repressive view of politics where much is said about security but little about freedom and justice , as demonstrated by the intensive series of Intergovernmental Conferences , Dublin , EUROPOL , EURODAC , EUROJUST and reciprocal assistance on legal matters , none of which are under the democratic control of Parliament , the Commission and the Court of Justice .
- ( DE ) Mr President , the programme ' Preserving the ecosystem ' would more correctly have been called ' Repairing the ecosystem ' , because with many of these programmes - and I need remind you only of the Structural Funds - we are continuing to destroy and rob the planet before we are even aware of all that it has to offer .
We welcome the fact that our proposals for a European loan to finance trans-European networks , which are currently at a standstill in the Council , have been included .
That 36 million people have to live with the HIV virus and that millions die of it every year must surely make an impression on those who only care about unborn lives and leave those who have been born to suffer and die .
I do not like to criticise a government whose political views are so close to my own , but in this case I would urge the French Government to consider whether it is in the interests of Africans to engage in African politics in this way .
Is it true that the Committee on Citizens Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs is getting down to it this evening ?
When a rapporteur from the left and a rapporteur from the right decide to address the same issue , the report from the left is pulled to pieces by honourable Members on the right .
At the same time , the United States have taken a threatening stand .
I would have liked more to have been said about monetary stability .
I would also like to say that I believe that we are just at the beginning of a long haul .
I do not think we need the Commission , or myself for that matter , to point to any other basis of policy than the Cairo Plan of Action .
After all , it is not we who develop a country ; it develops itself .
The original wording could have led to the spinning off of subsidiaries and the breaking up of companies by stealth .
In point of fact , Mr Oostlander , Kemalism was by no means a totalitarian system , and did not follow totalitarian models .
On the Commissions initiative , the European Conference on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings a Global Challenge for the Twenty-first Century was held from 18 to 20 September last year . The Brussels declaration was a concrete outcome of that conference .
Also from this point of view , it would be in our interest to ensure that the resolution contains only the important points , those that correspond , in fact , to the reasons why Parliament decided to draw up this report .
We have a lot to learn from India and we should approach today 's debate with a certain sense of humility in that regard .
It is difficult for the officials as well as for the ministers themselves .
We must deal with this situation by shaping it positively .
The negotiating parties did not even get round to addressing that topic in a concluding round of negotiations .
There does not seem to be any major disagreement between us on this matter .
Under the present parliamentary proposal , the budget for 2004 would allow for financial commitments amounting to EUR 112.3 billion , as against the figure of EUR 111.9 billion set by the Council and the EUR 112.2 billion proposed by the Commission .
Today , I am pleased to say that the European Council has endorsed our ideas for reviving the economy and stimulating growth and jobs .
Mr President , I wish to thank all the Members who made observations .
One particular demonstration of the truth that management can secure employment strategies by means other than collective redundancies is to be found in the motor industry , in the works contracts at VW or , most recently , at Opel , which reduce working time to thirty hours and thus share out the work among more people .
And that is what we are proposing .
It reflects the influence and the respect that the Union garners in all parts of our world .
Mr President , this budget for the other institutions sets the foundations for the imminent enlargement in stone .
This way of guaranteeing the patient optimum care and treatment is diametrically opposed to interference by the European Parliament in individual health care issues .
The next item is the report ( A 5 - 0479/2003 ) by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the development of the services sector for job creation ( 2003/2132 ( INI ) ) .
We also support the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs Ferrer , containing the essential elements of a European policy for the sector .
If we have more accountability built into the way we look at reform in these countries , I am sure we will have the kind of public services which deliver for people , make sure resources are used effectively and help us to pursue our own development goals of eradicating poverty and raising living standards .
It is urgent that we do something , and the Commission should not ignore the resolutions of this Parliament in this respect , nor the budget itself .
Mr President , I do not want to respond to what the Commissioner has said here , but simply to know when the minutes of yesterdays sitting will be adopted since I know they are not yet available .
We have also managed to get some very ambitious objectives of the regulation introduced , so that unintentional emissions too must cease at least in the longer term .
The most painful paragraphs in various reports pertain to the Roma , who are being discriminated against , disadvantaged and treated as second-class citizens everywhere , including in the current Member States .
It is also losing significant state contracts , which enabled it to maintain its public service obligations , because of the public procurement requirements .
It needs to be added , however , that there are many other problems that are just as serious .
From the very beginning , all those involved have recognised the difficulty of finding the answer to the question in front of us : what is the right balance between security demands and civil liberty ?
We have gone ten minutes over time , but I am very grateful to the Commissioner , who has played no small part in ensuring that it is no more than that .
At the recent Ecofin Council , the theory that it would be necessary to reform the Pact in 2005 gained ground .
In 24 States I had the privilege , on your behalf , to address the plenary sessions of national parliaments .
I can thus assure you that the work we are conducting is exhaustive and thoroughly objective .
The Commission is also looking at ways and means to take concrete action against illegal logging , while extending assistance to the Burmese population , especially on health and education , via international organisations .
Many of us in this House , however , are concerned that whilst maybe certain DGs within the Commission are interested in trade negotiations , it appears that DG VI in particular - the agriculture directorate - is perhaps hanging back a little bit .
On 2 April we argued in the report that we wished to declare our democratic responsibility with respect to the European Central Bank .
Mrs Lulling 's report on the ' proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 76/207/ EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment , vocational training and promotion , and working conditions ' is radical , and rightly so .
Anyone who would like to study this more in-depth should come and have a look at what has happened in the Netherlands and Belgium on this score , where neither country is particularly blameless .
The Israeli Government is entitled to take measures to protect its citizens from terrorism . Indeed it is its duty to do so . Nonetheless , if terrorism is to be dealt with effectively , it must be dealt with within the framework of international law .
I would like the President-in-Office to reaffirm his commitment to continue this kind of process to find the best way of ensuring that people know exactly what we do and what we do not do at European level .
What instruments does the Commission believe would give the Community the practical means required to impose such sanctions and does the Commission have the political power to introduce them ?
If the President of the Council of Ministers required to see a monument to the success to the Turin conference , then obviously he would have been greatly disillusioned and disappointed here this morning when he came to report on the conference to the European Parliament .
Let us ensure that they can assume an increasing amount of political responsibility and can thus effectively play an active part in helping to shape life in the European Union .
Do we want to make it happen ?
In a community based on the rule of law such as the European Union it seems that there can be no justification for pressurization and such blocking tactics as we have seen .
Furthermore , I learned this morning that the meeting had been cancelled at the last moment .
And like the French bar , we are opposed to the absence of genuine controls and restrictions on the activities of migrant lawyers in host Member States .
The British Government 's inept handling of the British-generated BSE crisis has led to collapsing beef sales all across Europe .
We have heard a number of stories of failed coordination which has hampered the effectiveness of that aid .
- ( FR ) Mr President , the Arias Cañete report on fishing problems in the North-Western Atlantic area comes before us at a time when it could hardly be more topical , since the Euro-Canadian declaration which should have been adopted by the Council last week is still under examination today .
The conventions , in other words international agreements , and intergovernmental cooperation in these domains are becoming increasingly unsuitable platforms from which to launch the campaign against crime in Europe .
Here in Parliament , we have on several occasions put forward very specific proposals concerning various aspects , including the harmonization of procedures , facilitating the return of abducted children , support measures for selfhelp organisations , better information , and the automatic provision of mutual assistance between courts .
Thirdly , this agreement falls within the framework of the European Union 's new policy towards Mediterranean countries .
We needed at least two months to do this work with the required care , even at maximum speed .
But , here again , you should recognize that the Commission does attack that , by avoiding the creation of dominant situations through its merger policy . That applies in your country too , Mr Wijsenbeek , because when the private channels pool their resources to try to dominate the market , we step in .
- Question 30 ( Fayot ) : The European Parliament 's right of initiative
In future the night sittings will be reported not just in one language but in both English and French .
At the present time there is a broad expression of support for more borrowing and lending activities but an unwillingness to change the mechanism for providing the resources that are necessary to the Guarantee Fund .
I feel I have to - and will make an attempt to - explain the situation factually and objectively and , to do so , I will simply refer to some newspaper headlines on events in Spain ( I am referring to the Spanish case ) : On 11 July 1992 , El Diario de Melilla ran a headline stating ' Reserve police forces to make Africans abandon their rally ' .
Recommendation for second reading ( A 4 - 0308/96 ) on behalf of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media , on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Decision on establishing a support programme in the field of books and reading ( Ariane ) ( C 4 - 0377/96 - 94/0189 ( COD ) ) ( rapporteur : Mrs Mouskouri )
The second point relates to a suitable budgetary allocation , as opposed to that proposed by the Council , which is totally inadequate and unacceptable .
Firstly , we have a legal framework .
I think that this is not sufficient reason to lose hope and weaken our efforts .
The granting of economic aid and also the establishment of closer links between the European Union and Croatia clearly depend on three factors of which I will remind you : firstly , total respect by Croatia of its obligations under the Dayton and Paris peace agreements .
The first is minimum social standards .
This logic , and this mechanism , are socially criminal and economically damaging to the Union .
The Commission is trying to address the plan in a way which will not give the idea that the situation is solved - far from it .
We need to build and push on forwards on the basis of these initial developments .
He or she ' may ' , Mrs Green , but it is not obligatory .
I think the European Union must not wait too long , otherwise we run the risk of allowing the Americans to seize the initiative once again .
It is right that the Community institutions should echo that , and the proposal for a regulation which is before us is along the right lines .
The EU must show understanding of the situation .
- ( ES ) Mr President , firstly allow me to thank the rapporteur , Mr Tillich , for his flexibility when discussing his document in committee , a place where there are not only contrasting ideological and regional views but also the contrasting views of the Council and of the Commission .
An example is the region of north east Italy where all of local wine production is sold and where further market outlets are needed .
These measures may seem small but they are still important to our common goal of mobility within the internal market .
In fact , telecommunication services and networks are fundamental if every citizen , enterprise or public authority is to have access to the type and amount of information that they need , including those situated in the least developed or peripheral regions .
The EC Treaty , and more precisely Article 90 , already provides for a satisfactory equilibrium between , on the one hand , the objectives of market integration and free competition , and on the other hand , objectives of general economic interest .
In the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy - and , even more so , in the Committee on Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection - we are always talking about internalizing all costs .
So in future we really should think of the citizens and be united and then we will also achieve more in China .
We can fully endorse the comments that some of the appropriations for the SAVE programme should be used to aid energy-efficient housing , and that all developments must be sustainable and take account of the protection of the environment , conservation of energy and best building practices ; these are also in line with the views of the great majority of the Danish population .
Farming is about producing food but also about managing the rural environment of which farmers are the main custodians .
What is regrettable is the absence of any prospects of opening up the Council of Ministers .
Economic relations are also political relations .
So it is good that the emphasis is being placed on projects both within the EU and outside , for example in Eastern Europe and the third world .
It sends us a constant stream of documents about the information society .
The Commission proposes that a European conference be convened to deal not with directly enlargement-related issues but rather with fields like foreign policy and the fight against international crime where we need our partners ' cooperation and the conference should forge closer links with all European associated countries aspiring to EU membership .
Some women 's lives could have been saved if their appeals for help had been heeded , and this shows that the problem of violence against women is related not only to domestic situations made difficult by marginalization or poverty ( there is violence against women in all social classes ) , but also to deep-rooted social values which make allowances for the attacker .
In addition to the cordoning off of the territories , Israel continues , in particular , to freeze the tax receipts due to the Palestinian authorities , even though as recently as Monday they announced they were going to free up half the amount due to the Palestinian authorities , that is 50 % of the amount , which equals some 50 million shekels .
It is a practical proposal that is being obstructed by Brussels .
Report ( A 4 - 0349/97 ) by Mr Orlando , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , on the draft Joint Action adopted by the Council on the basis of article K. 3 of the Treaty on European Union on making it a criminal offence to participate in a criminal organization in the Member States of the European Union ( 10407/97 - C 4 - 0480/97 - 97/0913 ( CNS ) )
- Madam President , I would like to thank my old friend Mr Ripa di Meana for his presentation this morning .
Regarding Irish meat , I would like to state very clearly that the Commission has protested strongly about the interference which has taken place in various British ports .
It will not necessarily mean extending the scope of the qualified majority decision as proposed by three Member States in a declaration appended to the treaty .
This is why it is important to harmonize emission levels in this area for all the Member States and for all companies , whatever their size .
- At the extraordinary meeting of the European Council on employment held in Luxembourg on 20 and 21 November 1997 , the Member States agreed unanimously on a new coordinated approach to tackling the Community-wide problem of unemployment , whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity and accepting that different nations ' situations will result in differing emphasis .
Would you not agree that a major contribution to raising the living standards of the Cuban people would be the immediate lifting of the American embargo ?
Nevertheless , I should like to take the opportunity to finish my sentence .
Some Member States have introduced additional measures on a national basis .
In response to the amendments proposed by Mr Grosch , Amendments Nos 4 and 5 add clarity to the text .
My other point is this : now is the time to consider the harmonization of penalties and their application throughout the whole Community , so that drivers penalized , say , in England , Wales or France are not still able to drive in Germany or Belgium .
We must deepen our existing contractual relations .
- ( FR ) We are regularly called upon to give our views on judicial and police matters .
We will do that in the latter part of the year .
It seems to me that is not a ' pretend ' decision of the Transport Council , it is a decision .
We ask the Public Prosecution Service to conduct the necessary enquiries , including cross-examining the Members , but to keep us informed and not to take any measures against the Members in question which could prevent them from carrying out their duties in our institution before we have been given an opportunity to express our view .
- Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group I would like to welcome the reports of Mrs Hautala , Hulthén and Pollack all of which make an important contribution to improving air quality and protecting human health in the environment within Europe .
A forward looking approach and new ideas are important , but both Socrates and ERASMUS as well as Youth for Europe ' have all become highly respected programmes in Europe over recent years and this situation should continue .
Similarly , we have doubts about the period specified by this Protocol - only two years , and therefore less than in most EC agreements of this type - which will not provide sufficient operational stability for the Community fleet .
There are many factors which determine the location of a business .
Howitt ( PSE ) . - Mr President , in welcoming this report I should like to highlight the purpose of my own amendments to the report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation .
It is very much a question of whether such an effort were feasible on the basis of the attitude of the leadership of the Yugoslavian army , which in itself is a positive signal , but something that can not be ruled out .
However , unfortunately during the negotiations a major change was introduced to accommodate British insistence on the veto .
I am thinking of the LIFE programme for example .
Recommendation for second reading ( A 4 - 0295/98 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , on the common position adopted by the Council ( C 4 - 0338/98 - 97/0039 ( SYN ) ) with a view to adopting a Council Directive establishing a safety assessment of third-country aircraft using Community airports ( Rapporteur : Mr González Triviño )
- ( SV ) We have now reached the final stage in this report 's lengthy passage through the House .
It is not even certain that , at the end of day , the euro will be as effective as expected in a globalised market whose finances are destabilised .
The system of emergency satellite or cellular links should cut reaction time for the emergency services by more than 40 % , and the survival rate should increase by between 7 and 12 % . The collision alert system , coupled with on-board computers , should increase driver safety and , what is more , the VMS should cut traffic delays by 20 % .
The West did not say it explicitly , but at the beginning , the reality was that they let Milosevic kill in Kosovo because he was said to be crushing the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army , whose revolt it was which shattered the deathly calm in Kosovo , and at last turned the eyes of the world on this miserable Serbian regime of apartheid .
Any further transfer of powers to UCLAF and the appropriation of more financial resources for the recruitment of officials must be undertaken as part of the control of fraud in the EU 's own institutions and must not constitute a move towards a European prosecution authority .
The only thing left , therefore , was a Community approach to the problem involving harmonisation of the rules protecting services based on , or consisting of the provision of conditional access .
In this respect , I should like to point out that the two debates that took place in committee were marked by unanimity and a common desire to accept the proposals put forward by the Commission through increased effort .
Allied to that , the committee has also protected the ability of national preferences and regional variations to continue , whilst at the same time accepting that certain standards of accessibility are required .
- ( ES ) Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , nobody doubts that a reform is necessary and nobody doubts that the common agricultural policy is not entirely fulfilling the role assigned to it in the Treaty .
The people who lose out are public sector employees in the respective countries .
I regret that this is rather late but we only took up our posts in 1995 and the screening could not be carried out overnight .
Slovakia has changed course , towards a normal democratic system in which there is respect for the constitution , acceptance of opposition , a directly elected president , a transparent society with a place for every citizen , including the Hungarian minority which is represented in the new government and , most importantly , where there is an attitude of openness towards the European Union .
I now regret that this opportunity has not been grasped to abolish the fund or to stipulate that Members wishing to belong to it must finance it entirely from their own pockets .
A first meeting took place in Ottawa on 7 and 8 December 1998 .
So now and then we should also try to do so through political decisions .
I have apologised to you , Commissioner , because I can not stay .
This is somewhat illogical when what really disrupts the welfare of the hens is that they can not satisfy the particular egg-laying needs which are natural to them .
In any case , when I meet President Santer , which happens very often now , I will raise the question with him .
- ( FR ) Madam President , human rights and citizens ' rights are not principles that are infinitely variable .
Politics is the art of reality , not of utopia .
I personally belong to the group which supports the Commission 's seven-year rule but not the simplified procedure , although a simplified procedure could become a possibility if we considered a renewal of the marketing authorisation for the products , in other words extending the seven years .
We can not expect to see perfect results immediately .
In other words , public budgets are being asked to continue to bear the burden of infrastructure funding , while private railway undertakings are exploiting the capacity of the rail networks .
I support the comments made by Mr Trakatellis on the difficulties and the fundamental inability of Greek producers to carry out tobacco transfers . Greek producers are small and medium-sized tobacco producers and it is impossible to replace the qualities they cultivate . Essentially , in the infertile soil where the tobacco is grown , it is impossible for them to switch to better varieties in such a short time .
I therefore expect the Council of Ministers to prepare a very forthright declaration on Colombia for the forthcoming UN meeting in Geneva .
Amendments Nos 9 and 13 concern the issue of the good faith of the economic operators .
On the matter of working conditions as well , the Commission is seeking equal treatment irrespective of whether the crew members are resident in a Member State or not .
I quote : ' the external auditor ( the Court of Auditors ) produced reports which were clear and to the point ( for example in 1992 and 1996 on tourism and in 1996 on MED and ECHO ) . However , only one of the two arms of the budgetary authority ( Parliament ) gave them proper consideration ' .
In a few weeks , the Amsterdam Treaty will enter into force .
I should like to express my sincere thanks to him for that and for this annual report .
With this in mind , I ask you to vote in favour of this report .
We are pleased to find that all these points are referred to in the draft resolution .
My Group can see no reason not to grant discharge for the 1996 budget .
In view of the philosophy that I have explained , I believe that our position is understandable .
I have always had confidence in this .
Divergent national regulations should not be allowed to develop at all , or become established over and above the current scope .
We are pleased with the far greater emphasis given to fighting the trade in human beings than to action against its victims in relation to illegal immigration .
We believe , however , that it is important for this to be carried out during the planning stage so as to allow employees to anticipate change , extending the Directives field of application and ensuring that it contains minimum provisions at Community level , derogations from which may be allowed only if they are more favourable to employees , as well as extending the content to the areas which directly affect the workers and their future .
I understand that such a reform will have to target national contributions that correspond effectively to the respective economic development , so the GNP will have to be strengthened as an essential indicator for such contributions .
We demanded that this period should be reduced to four years , with a maximum weekly working time of fifty-four hours ( subject to negotiation ) during that time .
Mr Heaton-Harris , if you have doubts about what I announced then you must ask for an electronic confirmation of the outcome of the vote , as other Members do when they have doubts . It is quite simple .
I want to congratulate Mr Schwaiger on putting together what I regard as a decent framework within which to move forward .
However , as in many other areas , the reason that contracts have been awarded to countries like Korea is surely because of the conditions that apply : for example workers in such countries get very low wages , working conditions and safety measures are very poor and unsatisfactory , because the health and safety of workers is not a priority .
May I just warn against the Commission and the Council confining themselves to just four areas when they now produce the concrete programme following the Beijing Conference . I say this after 20 years experience of the United Nations .
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime .
Mr President , I voted for the Decourrière report on the Community initiative INTERREG , mainly because of the reply Commissioner Barnier gave to some Members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime frontiers . I voted for it , not just because I was born in a coastal town , Genoa , but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too .
Are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services ?
Mr President , human rights are universal , indivisible , interrelated and interwoven .
It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola .
I think that setting dates is very important to our also in actual fact attaining the objectives .
I urge both institutions to turn it into something tangible , something concrete , and to do something constructive with it .
10 . Considerably limits the present derogations for cement kilns .
Yet it is they who are controlling what we know and it is they who control what coverage we get and we must be circumspect .
This poverty focus is essential in order to actually get value for money .
The Commission should mostly be able to act under its own responsibility and if it has to consult Member States it will be on the simplest possible advisory basis .
What matters most is what we are doing right now to get help to the starving .
Not that this was ever disputed for the European Central Bank .
In reality , however , the text before us is so obsessed with hunting down discrimination that it completely loses sight of the basic principles of the rule of law and even , to crown it all , the principle of equal treatment between persons .
Mr President , smoking is bad for the health .
The aim of the European Unions policy in the telecommunications sector is to fully liberalise the markets , develop competition and privatise public-sector corporations .
There is a lack of agreement between Member States , even among Sports Ministers .
You can not ignore the fact that , if we do not adopt support measures for nuts and locust beans , many crops will eventually be abandoned .
In this particular case , I am entirely confident that Günter Verheugen fully supports the Commissions policy , which this House has approved on many occasions .
The objectivity of my report is certified by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy .
Mr President , politicians often have the difficult task of telling constituents that no matter how heartfelt their grievance , or how strong its moral base , there is no legal remedy .
The future is thereby assured , and the prospect is taking shape of a great Community embracing people of different languages , customs and beliefs , with this Parliament as one of the institutional bodies .
I think I can say that we met these conditions .
These public health proposals will therefore send a strong message to all citizens , especially the youngest Europeans .
The de facto tax-free status of much US e-commerce must have had a tremendous impact in encouraging the new economy and its phenomenal success in the US . This tax is unenforceable , why should we spend the time and the money and the effort on creating a tax that we can not collect .
In its monthly report for July 2000 , the European Central Bank as already issuing serious warnings .
For example , in Germany , my own party , the CDU , has a woman leader and in the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and the European Democrats a considerable number of the national delegations are led by women .
How much offal has accumulated for destruction and how is it being stored ?
I must draw your attention to the fact that such a regime already exists and is set forth in Regulation ( EEC ) No 389/1982 . Moreover , the creation of producers organisations has been financed by the Community for the past ten years .
I applaud the rapporteur for introducing a time limit for the Council decision .
The Commission considers that the process of promoting more flexible forms of work should be encouraged and that efforts should continue to relax the existing restrictive legal framework on the protection of work even more , i.e. in order to allow more economic uncontrolled mass redundancies .
We also have to look at EU economic policy and its impact on Ireland in relation to interest rates , over which we no longer have any control .
If not , when will it be in operation ?
The document by the European Commission , on the other hand , gives a clear analysis of the issue .
I believe we must show respect for the decision taken in the Irish referendum .
I am happy to report that one of those , the establishment of an Irish Forum on the Future of Europe , has now been adopted by the Irish Government .
I will refer to a series of amendments , which will be listed specifically tomorrow , which I can not accept at the moment , although I agree with their content .
I think those of us who participate in the fisheries committee in this parliament do not always get the credit for what they achieve or indeed what the Commission achieves .
We must ask the Americans to be more active and to try once again to guide the people of the region .
We are filled with grief and horror in the face of this disaster , a disaster which must never be repeated , and the forces of civilisation throughout the world must now work shoulder to shoulder with the United States to bring those responsible for this attack to account , and we must work closely together to prevent future terrorist attacks .
It is perfectly fair that an asylum seeker from , say , Canada , will have a greater job convincing the authorities that asylum is justified , compared to someone coming for example from Iraq .
There is scope for more public investment . There can be more public involvement , always of course within the rules laid down in the system we have created for ourselves to ensure more effective operation of the balance between monetary and fiscal policy .
For instance , would the President-in-Office tell me who so far has been charged with complicity in the murder of President Lumumba and the installation of the psychopath Mobotu , which resulted in great pain for the former colony of the Congo ?
I regret but I have to tell you that certain Member States do not seem to share these priorities .
Mr President , first of all , I should like to thank the various interlocutors and groups for their observations .
But we will have to start and I am convinced of this by creating a true common EU foreign and security policy with a common conscience that is efficient , coherent and visible , as Mr Broks report recommends .
I would therefore like to thank the Commission , which I see is still represented here .
Lastly , Mr President , financial resources gained from water-pricing policies should be used to improve infrastructures , which would prevent water loss in transport , for example , and would ensure better and increased access to this resource .
The Commission 's suggestion that only biotechnology should be promoted in the health context is too narrow .
This kind of tossing the ball back and forth is not acceptable with regard to getting the Members time schedules organised .
So any car can take low-sulphur fuel and it has a positive effect , especially with older types of diesel engines .
We would also emphasise that this type of aid , that is to say , contributions in combination with a long-term soft loan , must be seen as exceptional and not allowed to constitute the norm for the future .
It is understandable that honourable Members should think that there is some confusion in our management strategy for the whole region , But I do not feel that I am being inconsistent in arguing , on the one hand , that we have to work through Europe Aid , through deconcentration , which has now begun and which we must now push as rapidly as possible , while on the other hand , saying there may be odd occasions , particularly crises , which require different sort of arrangements .
On the environment , the United States , which is not a party to the Kyoto agreement , did not associate itself with us , and on social affairs , all the European trade unions have expressed their highly negative opinions about Doha .
We note that these African partners are already exerting effective peer pressure on Mugabe so that a solution to the crisis may be found .
It is very characteristic of the state of affairs in todays Europe that , actually , only someone like former Commissioner , Mr Van Miert , dared to put his finger on the wound .
You have not said what you think about more Europe .
Clearly also , priority should be given to setting up intercultural dialogue and establishing a genuine Euro-Mediterranean partnership in the social , cultural and human fields .
There are many other conditions we could perhaps apply .
Tourism should become treaty based , not so that operators incur excessive regulation indeed , the growth of the industry depends upon its ability to innovate independently but so that it is seen as a serious European issue .
Anyone at all can come and say whatever they like .
So I am looking for major and clear assurances of intent in that area .
On occasions , they ask the Commission questions about issues on which we ourselves have to decide .
This should not , and can not , entail the undermining of our principle of voluntary ' gratis ' self-sufficiency .
One such aspect is the priority ' Global change and ecosystems ' , given that the fisheries sector was subjected to swingeing budgetary cuts under the Sixth Framework Programme for research , with its budget being reduced from EUR 880 million under the previous programme to only EUR 570 million .
The Commission proposal is barking up the wrong tree here .
The financial resources approved in Monterrey , which have been mentioned by the representative of the Commission , represent a step forward , but everyone agrees that they are insufficient .
We must maintain Eurocontrol and its prerogatives and we must , therefore , firstly clarify the prerequisites of regulatory relations with this body .
One year on , we are of course all aware that the struggle against terrorism , as President Bush himself once said , will be a long one at various levels , and that quick victories are illusory .
There is even less information available regarding employers organisations .
I want to address Commissioner Nielson directly in saying that we did not expect all our demands to be met , but it is sometimes the case that the tone is what matters in music , and at times our side was dissatisfied with the way the parliamentarians were negotiated with or spoken to .
Or is the focus in respect of these inherently sound intentions on the social directives ?
Regarding openness and the participation of partners , I wish to emphasise what has been said about the social partners .
However , employment legislation and the world have moved on since 1911 .
The people in these countries have been prepared to accept sacrifices , dilution and chaos in the hope that they would be rewarded with major inflows of money from the EU from the time of their accession .
One issue that separates us is the civil war in Chechnya .
These lorries sometimes hog the carriageway for several kilometres and cause many accidents and traffic-jams .
I wish you every success .
I believe that this is the opinion even of those Members who were here just now but have just left the House holding up placards saying No to war , not realising that , in doing so , they are making war more likely .
Unemployment should be coming down .
Instead of the usual group of foreign ministry officials meeting together behind closed doors we will have a publicly representative body taking ideas from a wide public debate and coming up with a coherent set of proposals for reform .
Mr President , is the directive on the European limited liability company a good thing or not ?
It is simply a situation which we should not accept .
The result was huge discrimination and a large group of practising Irish architects of great ability and experience failed to get their status recognized elsewhere in the Community . This situation continues to this very day .
Report ( A 4 - 0193/97 ) by Mr Spencer , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and defence Policy , on progress in implementing the common foreign and security policy ( January to December 1996 )
The possibilities for derogation are restricted and subject to mandatory conditions .
I can tell you that so far as Lebanon is concerned there is perfect agreement between the European Union and the United States , and that is something which clearly emerged from yesterdays talks .

The following evidence may be added to what we have already heard . About one in three of the films made in the EU is never shown in a cinema , and a large percentage of those that do make it into the cinema are watched by a total audience of fewer than 130 000 . A film will not normally start to yield a return on the initial investment until a million cinemagoers have paid to watch it .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the present time makes it possible for us to observe what a misjudgment it is for European states , with their present dimensions , to define their interests solely in national terms , and how impossible it is to get national interests to prevail in global disputes such as these .
This situation has not changed since the first Statement of Assurance was published in respect of the 1994 budgetary year .

Madam President , my group was one of those which wanted to have a document allowing an exchange of views on the Commissions strategic objectives within the group before this debate , instead of being reduced to an on-the-spot reaction in plenary .

Rübig ( PPE ) , in writing .

Do not harm yourselves even further with such reprehensible actions .
The thing that strikes us about this report from the Committee on Budgets - and this is a point that was made on a number of occasions in the committee , including by the rapporteur himself - is that we do not actually have enough information yet to produce an accurate picture of what the budgetary effects of enlargement are going to be .
There is broad agreement on extending qualified-majority voting and codecision powers to a range of different policy matters in the domain of both the European Council and the European Parliament .
If so , in what way ?
Thank you for your attention .
Commissioner , you said at one point in your reply that UNMIK was endeavouring to create a legal and institutional framework for Kosovo .

Subsequent amendment , including altering the ceiling , is therefore still possible .
On the other hand , we shall have to take care - and this is a point that has frequently come to my attention here in Parliament - to exercise our responsibility for keeping our reports within the legal bounds we have set for ourselves .
It would create untenable conflicts of interest , not to say some constitutional gymnastics , if either Court were to be directly involved in the Commission 's internal procedures .

I should like to conclude by thanking Parliament for its clear and unqualified support for enlargement , expressed this morning and reflected in the report submitted .
( DE ) No , Mr Papayannakis , the Commission does not have any such proposals and I must make it quite clear that I would have great concerns about agreeing to the idea that the Roma issue should be ' Europeanised ' by treating Roma as a transnational European minority with their own European minority status .
The new equal opportunities created for us in the Treaty of Amsterdam must be grasped fully . But henceforth let the message from here be : men and women oppose violence against women , against children , against all .
- on the Fayot report ( A 4 - 0006/98 )
The Vietnamese Government is conducting a vigorous campaign against the Protestant Montagnards via television .
The NGO platform , with which Parliament and the Commission have maintained dialogue , and all those involved feel as if they have been taken for a ride , and I think that we parliamentarians also feel rather as if we have been deceived , when declarations are made saying one thing and then , in reality , practical decisions lead to another .

So I shall not concentrate so much on looking back at our common policy over the past year , but will try to look forward .
If it were more open and more transparent , it would be more reassuring to those who have legitimate cause to be concerned .

This by no means contradicts the fact that a healthy budgetary situation is fundamental if we are to respond rapidly to adverse economic situations and , at the same time , to control the public deficit . After all these are basic elements for economic growth and subsequent job growth .

In contrast to his predecessor Helmut Kohl who , five years ago , accepted the oppositions nomination for the Commission and it was not easy for me to vote for Monika Wulf-Mathies in 1994 Schröder was not prepared to give consideration to the views of todays opposition , the CDU / CSU , the victors in the European elections in Germany .

Firstly , the method of registration of a .E.U domain .
Using political means we can have an effect on a political war , which is now what it has become .

Mr President , some speakers in the House today have said somewhat critically that this discussion is dominated by emotions .

Jobs are tied up in this .
- ( FI ) Madam President , when the new Member States got involved in EU policy , they got involved in a new sea too , one which is now an EU sea .
Accordingly , given our history of success in conflict resolution in Europe , would it not be a very good thing if , during the Irish presidency , you were to persuade the Commission to set up a special department of peace and reconciliation so that , instead of sending armies to areas of conflict , a team of people equipped with the European Union 's philosophy and principles is dispatched to those areas , since today we are in a stronger position to shape the world ?

The analysis for the year is in many respects a follow-up to the sterling work carried out a year ago by Mr Lipietz .
How can anyone accept the fact that the Councils conclusions make only passing reference to social inclusion and refer only to children suffering from poverty , without putting forward a multifaceted and integrated programme to combat poverty and social exclusion ?
Those directives have been ignored and that has a powerful political significance : once again it is not an issue of a procedural or institutional nature .
However , we have to be realistic and we should take the improvements that are now on offer .
We must act decisively albeit with a certain degree of tolerance both towards Kostunica , whom we shall be receiving here tomorrow , and the new Yugoslav authorities .
Gradin , Commission .

Needless to say , we totally agree that education , public health and the audiovisual sector are sectors that have to be treated separately , and we would like to keep it that way . The European Union has always been one of the advocates of this WTO Round and as the world 's largest trade bloc , it owes it to itself to continue to work hard and make Cancun a runaway success .
It is natural for such an important sector of intervention to find its own clear and established legal basis : this is the objective of the draft Regulation that we are examining on a second reading today .

So this issue of relocations is one that we have to discuss together , as we gain control of our research efforts and denounce national policies aimed at reducing it .
The PDB obviously did not take some items of expenditure into account , but it was very clear .
The anti-globalisation movement has been able to redirect its activities and to define a new organisational method that has resulted in the World Social Forum being no longer just a platform for demands but also a platform for proposals .
That is extremely important for the consumer .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , ladies and gentlemen , the third important subject for the European Council in Florence is the so-called ' mad cow ' crisis that has shaken the Union over the last few months .

The inequalities between Member States have been reduced , but there is still a gulf separating rich and poor regions .
To have some coherence between the tax policy and social security system in one country would already be something , but to expect this to happen between countries is nothing short of utopia . As a result , frontier workers continue to be at the receiving end of this unsatisfactory situation .
There are none
It is important to stress that these regions , despite the progress , are still structurally and infrastructurally handicapped .
The rapporteur recognises this by repudiating that specific point .
You will remember that , towards the end of the negotiations , Mr Prodi agreed that the word institutions in the text should be changed to the Council and the Commission , so that it will be possible , upon the Presidents intervention , for documents which are issued by the Commission to recipients outside the Council and the Commission also to be issued to MEPs .

van Velzen , W.G.. ( PPE ) , rapporteur .

Then the guarantee of the State could come into play only if the system had exhausted all its funds ( in the event of a major disaster ) .
Eisma ( ELDR ) , draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection .
A divided Europe can have no part in this .
For a liberal , considerations of trade and short-term benefits can not come before the defence of human rights .
Since I agree with the position set out by the rapporteur , I will make three very brief remarks . Firstly , I think that it was a positive decision not to extend the programme to related diseases , not because they are less important , but because we should not disperse our resources and efforts .
This is a clear illustration of the danger of setting excessively high quotas , but this has been going on for years and it is still continuing .
There is huge concern about the balance between security and civil liberties being tipped too far towards security in the United States .
The management of PHARE is also to be reformed .
The inclusion in any constitution of a military agency whose aim is to promote common military procurement and to improve the arms industry 's efficiency just beggars belief .
But we could reduce it if the idea of Europe were understood as a common political task for the people of Europe regardless of their region and social position .
I do not think it sensible for the EUs long-term financial perspectives to be wrapped up in an accumulated cost of EUR 2 billion for maintaining two places of work .
These were the basic ideas I wanted to bring out in the interview .
In particular , the Commission proposes an end to the distinction between full-time and part-time farmers that is made in the present regulation , since this differentiation has frequently obstructed the successful application of the aid regime .
But that is the reality .

I propose a package of measures central to which is the theme of access to justice , much trumpeted at Tampere .

- ( FR ) Mr President , the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations would like to issue an appeal to the forthcoming Cardiff European Council .
It is a question to a large extent of the press not reporting properly what is happening in this place and in other institutions of the Community .
That is why the central issues for the European Council are to be internal security matters , with further progress on Schengen as decided upon in the Treaty of Amsterdam , reinforcement of the forces of oppression and persecution at European level , strengthening of the CFSP and promotion of the requisite statutory changes which will establish the abolition of the veto and unanimity , and the generalisation of the majority-vote rule .
However , I think we need to accept that America must change its Middle East policy .

It has been deadly serious , combative certainly , and it has come forward with a range of proposals which do this House very great justice .
Mr President , could I draw your attention and that of the services to paragraph 12 of the proposed resolution ?
The framework agreement is a mess .
Mr President , Mr Baltas has made a very balanced recommendation to the Council with regard to Croatia 's application for accession to the EU. It names quite categorically the main areas of persistent concern from the point of view of the EU , which are good neighbourliness , the refugee issue and cooperation with the International Yugoslavia Tribunal .
With regard to the task of reconstruction , which can not be delayed , the Commission must offer the same level of support it provided in terms of emergency humanitarian aid for countries affected by Hurricane Mitch , or something similar .

Mr President , as the rapporteurs fine report points out , the figures recently published by the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work , whose headquarters are in Bilbao , indicate very differing results in relation to work accidents between the various Member States , owing to the fact that the States are not applying uniform statistical criteria .
My group thinks it is right that the Garosci report only deals with the control of duty-free sales . Indeed , the European Commission 's report on the subject is rather out of date .
It is also necessary to use local employment initiatives to create more employment .
- Mr Tomlinson , would you please give me the documents concerned .
Fourthly , I believe that this proposal , while achieving these objectives from the point of view of the simplification of formal obligations , savings in the financial costs to companies and the strengthening of electronic services , in no way jeopardises the administrative control necessary for the application of the tax .
We need to build it anew and ensure there is prosperity and peace .

However , the events of the last few months - the raid on the Northern Bank , the murder of Robert McCartney , the intimidation of witnesses , the evidence of money laundering - suggest there is extensive criminality , which has now become part and parcel of the Northern Ireland scene .
I should like to illustrate this with a topical example . This morning , we voted on a request for urgency from the Council , on which the rapporteur was Mr Garriga Polledo .
The report by the honourable Member Mrs Zimmerman on the protection of minors rightly emphasises the importance of safeguarding children 's rights .
We in the European Parliament must address this issue when we deliberate our relations with Russia .
The debate is closed .
Mr President , how else am I to interpret the statement which Iranian ex-President Rafsanjani made last Friday ?
Brittan , Commission .
The EBRD has been largely concentrating its activities on developing small and mediumsized businesses , developing , on the one hand , aid programmes for local banks , and , on the other , promoting the establishment of banks specialising in providing loans to small and mediumsized enterprises and microloans .
Mr President , the Durban Conference provided an important opportunity to condemn the phenomenon of racism and xenophobia , sending out a clear and powerful message , the need for and importance of which remain highly relevant today .
In my own country , the tax regime is quite innovative in many ways .

It is in legislative terms the second and final major tranche of the Commission reform programme , so when the Council adopts this proposal all the essential building blocks will be in place for making sure the Commission becomes more efficient and more effective than it has ever been .

We must defend them and give them a chance .

The transition in Slovakia no doubt comes too close to the Vienna summit , and the Vienna summit will not be able to take a decision on whether or not Slovakia can be included in the first group of acceding countries .
The third thing I should like to highlight is the issue of programmes .
Although the issue of ageing is generally associated with long-term concerns , it already presents a major challenge for society and for governments because of its profound implications for policies of social security , employment , education , health , immigration and the family . This means that the necessary measures must be adopted to ensure that the income and resources available to elderly and retired people remain in line with average living standards in society .
Well , because nothing is easy in today 's complex world of globalization , economic development and the liberalization of the electricity and energy markets , so we shall have to see how we can promote all of this .

As Mr Metten said , on the one hand we have the bikers , who seem to revel in noise , fumes and dirt , and on the other we have the powerlessness of those who , as far as Parliament is concerned , simply have to accept that these young people have the right to come and disturb them .
I would like to conclude by saying : let us hope , at the end of this parliamentary term , that the federalist ideals and the federalist method will very quickly prevail , with the accession to the European Union of Israel and of a Palestinian state of the kind you want to see : one founded on freedom and not on the abuse of power .
I will start with the first of Mrs Paulsens reports , dealing with the directive on the monitoring of zoonotic agents .
So saying it as clearly as we do here may sound wrong .
President .
I wonder whether or not it could be possible to compensate for the refusal to share responsibility out of some European Union fund or other .
I am particularly pleased that today sees the opening of the Third Multiannual Programme to a first group of seven countries for the period 1998-2000 , namely Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Poland , Romania and the Slovak Republic .
There is one thing worse than a public monopoly , and that is a private monopoly .

But we also have to act in the medium term , I insist , with a more ambitious measure ; this single airspace and this common management of the single airspace by the fifteen Members .

The Irish presidency is to be congratulated on making this issue one of its top priorities .
This is one crucial message contained in your motion for a resolution to which I fully subscribe .

There is a period of ten years in the case of ordinary citizens and of 50 years for those who are under suspicion .
That will add substantially to the costs of monitoring with no benefit to the environment , as the monitoring obligations have not just been imposed on those plants where ammonia emissions are generally produced .
The proposals put forward by the report do not however solve these problems .
Wibe ( PSE ) .
Why are matters like this ? Because the fact is that Russia is a huge power at our borders , and no one knows exactly how to take the bull by the horns , all the more so because everyone wants to have Russia on its side .
We want there to be equal distribution and equal rights between women 's organisations .
Therefore , in order to set my values straight , I have decided to make a dull but clear speech , something along the lines of God , country and family , hinging on the subject of Europes Christian roots , which is not an ideological subject but one of democratic procedures .
The Council was extremely pleased to see an end to military action and the unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 1483 on post-war Iraq .

In spite of the stream of protests from , for example , India and Malaysia , the least developed countries , the G 77 group , China and a host of environmental and solidarity movements , the EU intends , together with the United States , to try to play its trump card by making the WTOs free trade doctrine apply not only to traditional trade but to practically the whole of economic life .
The building and sowing season is starting in Bosnia and it is most important , moreover , that the people of former Yugoslavia should see visible signs of progress in advance of September 's elections .
It will also make things harder for terrorists in the Member States .
- I am glad to vote for this excellent report by my British Labour colleague David Thomas .
Our proposal makes mutual recognition possible precisely because the sign is issued under the control of the national authorities as part of an official numberplate , and that would clearly not be the case for the separate sticker .

Regarding heading 3 internal expenditure there is now the opportunity , in the wake of the Barcelona process , to make considerably more active use of funds for trans-European networks , for the development of small enterprises , etc. I believe this is vital .

There is also a strong link between the military regime and drugs producers : most of the world 's heroin comes from Burma .
To begin to do so would be to trigger a conflagration in the Balkans on a scale bigger than any we have seen in recent years .
Other problems persist of course , but the Commission " s services are endeavouring to co-operate closely with those parties responsible at a national level , and we want to resolve the issues outstanding as quickly as possible .
But , admirably led by Mr Michel , as has been said , it rose to the challenge .
The initial evaluation , and that carried out after five years , provide the opportunity to weigh up the added therapeutic value of medicinal products .
If that is so at least it sets out for us the extent of the political battle that would need to be fought to secure what I would regard as a minimal concession to hold this study , which itself is a prerequisite to the real issue of fighting for some retention of this particular possibility of duty-free sales .
Special consideration will be given to regions with specific needs , such as Kaliningrad and the Arctic region .

One of my concerns is not actually about this year or next year but about the new programme which starts in the year 2000 .

The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commissions implementing a series of reforms , so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commissions period of office is not repeated .
At every level , genuine progress has been made , and we should tell the negotiators as much , and congratulate the Dutch presidency .
This is a subject to which the Commission is particularly sensitive . As you well know , we have not been content with just a directive but we have also brought out a Green Paper in which we tried to respond to the important problem of the protection of children .
That seems to me what actually happened .
It lays down a procedure for ensuring that shipments of radioactive waste take place only after all the states involved have given prior informed consent .
Finally , I can mention a database for wine , covering over 10 000 wines , and the fight against fraud in the area of wine , alcohol and spirits .

I do not agree with Mr Lewandowski when he suggests that we , in our proposals the Councils draft proposal compared to the Commissions proposals would have mainly used the cheese slicer method , as we put it in the Netherlands , that we would have made use of generic cutbacks across the line .
This vision must include a democratic voice via a parliament and the involvement of civil society .
Not all the problems , however , have been solved - far from it .
The EET scheme , in which premium contributions are not taxed but in which the payments are taxed , can then offer a direction for the mutual harmonisation of the fiscal rules concerning pensions .
