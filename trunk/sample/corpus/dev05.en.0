I declare that the period of sessions of the European Parliament that was interrupted on July 7 , 2005 , has been resumed .
Let me now make a statement that makes reference to the events that we have lived through this summer
As you will remember , on July 7 last , in the final one of our sessions before the holidays , we were surprised by the terrorist attacks that hit London whose victims , as we feared at that time , were very numerous .
The terrorist threat to Europe continues and it is a problem which the vents of July and those that followed them will compel us to grant it a special importance .
But this summer has also been noted for other grave events : the persistence of terrorism in Iraq , terrible natural disasters and accidents that have caused pain to many families in thee world - especially here in Europe and , very particularly , in the United States .
You must know that , every time that one of these events has taken place this summer , on behalf of the European parliament , your President has immediately relayed the testimony of our solidarity and has addressed himself the authorities of the countries affected by these dramas .
Every time they have happened we have let our voice be heard .
And I believe that it is good that we today associate ourselves , in a general sense , with the pain of the families that have lost their loved ones in the lethal conflicts affecting the planet .
The United States , which is today suffering a drama of surprising proportions that is moving the whole world , merits special mention .
It seems as though the number of victims will be very high . The number of people leaving their homes runs into the thousands and the financial damage and the harm to the social structure are very significant .
Terrorism kills numerous people , blow by blow , every day in Iraq .
It is enough to see the rumour , as happened a few weeks ago , for a wave of panic on a bridge in Baghdad to take the lives of over a thousand people .
Dramatic plane and civil helicopter accidents have caused the death of over 400 people in Indonesia , Greece , Venezuela , Peru and the Baltic Sea , and also in Afghanistan , where European military personnel - on this occasion Spaniards , but they could have been from any European country - have died following a helicopter accident .
I think that it is right that we now remember the words that the President of Afghanistan , Karzai , said to us , when here in this Assembly he stressed the important role that the troops of European countries play in defence of human rights and keeping the peace in that country .
There has been more : disastrous floods in Austria , Germany , Bulgaria , Rumania and Switzerland have taken the lives of dozens of people and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless .
Severe financial damage due to excessive rain in the middle of Europe and serious economic damage due to the terrible drought that the other half of Europe is suffering , a drought the fuels forest fires , especially in Portugal , France and Spain , have cost the lives of the dozens of people , including firemen and plane pilots who take part in the struggle against the flames .
The mark that this environmental damage has left , due to an excess of water in some cases , due to a lack of it in others , will be very hard to erase and we have to remember that the violence of these phenomena is a consequence of the imbalances that the European Union has paid special importance to and which it will have to continue doing .
Colleagues , in the light of most of these dramas , the European Union has demonstrated its capability of mobilising itself and quickly helping to rescue the victims .
Our capacity for prevention and action has to be placed at the service of an approach for solidarity .
Our Parliament will have the opportunity to debate this topic today , in the context of the statements of the Commission entered in our agenda and we will soon have to legislate on the strengthening of air safety .
After this brief review of the dramatic news of this summer that I have just given , let me - now that we are here again - ask you for one minute 's silence to express our solidarity with all of the victims and convey our deepest sympathy to them .
The definitive plan for the agenda for this partial period of sessions , approved by the Conference of Presidents at their meeting last Thursday September 1 , has been distributed , in accordance with sections 130 and 131 of the Regulations .
No request for modification was submitted for Monday or Tuesday .
So , the agenda will be the one that you know about for Monday and Tuesday .
Wednesday : As a consequence of a discussion that took place at the President 's Conference , the Greens / Europe Free Alliance Group has requested that Mr. Brok 's report , on the proposal for Decision of the Council relating to the signing of the additional protocol to the Agreement be added . Under this Agreement , an association is created between the European Economic Community and Turkey as a consequence of the enlargement of the European Union .
Owing to the complex nature of the subject , I feel that it is necessary for someone to explain this request .
Mrs. Frassoni would like to do it .
The European Popular Group has asked that the debate on the situation of prisoners in Syria be replaced by the subject of human rights in Byelorussia .
Thank you , Mr. Poettering .
I am sure that the Presidents of the political groups will take good note of your request and will thus deal with it in setting the agenda for the next partial period of sessions .
According to our agenda we are now going to move on to the requests for one-minute speeches , which we are going to continue developing in accordance with the instructions that I informed you about by letter and which , bit by bit , are going to allow us to set out this point in a more organised way .
Mr. President , dear colleagues , I would like to draw your attention to the case of Francisco Larra単aga , a Spanish citizen , and a citizen of the European Union , condemned to the death penalty in the Philippines .
Regrettably , a few weeks ago , Philippine justice upheld the death sentence of this citizen , and the countdown clock has begun ticking . We know that the trial is plagued with irregularities and that the absence of a defence for Paco Larra単aga is a reality , since he was seen in another place on the same day and at the same time at which the crime he is charged with was committed .
But the fundamental thing now is to save the life of Mr. Larra単aga and all institutions must add their grain of sand to this fair demand .
Colleagues , they are going to kill a citizen of the European Union , and we can not remain unmoved faced with the violation and infringement of the first human right of any citizen , which is life .
This is why I ask the Presidency of this Parliament to urgently contact the Philippine government and the President of that country and to ask them to apply the right of clemency to Francisco Larra単aga , so that this Spanish and European citizen is not executed .
Many thanks , Mr. Iturgaiz , for calling the attention of the Presidency to this citizen 's situation .
We will find out about the case and , if it is pertinent , we would act accordingly following your proposal .
Mr. President , as the Commissioner on the Environment has reminded us , we have been victims of disasters caused by fire and water in the European Union this summer , and while some regions are seriously threatened by creeping desertification , others are still fearful of floods .
This is an example of European diversity and of the need to be sensitive to external realities .
The fires have caused the loss of dozens of human lives , the evacuation of entire populations and extraordinary ecological damage in diverse Member States of the south of Europe .
It is true that we are suffering a year of drought , but I believe it is not acceptable to resign ourselves and shelter behind fatality .
On the contrary , it is our responsibility to analyse the deep causes of the disasters that are repeating themselves year after year and to see what we are doing wrong , or simply , what it is that we are not doing .
For this reason , the European Popular Party Group is proposing the creation of a temporary commission in our Chamber .
This commission should evaluate specific measures that we could adopt in the European sphere to contribute towards complementing those that are being set underway by the Member States .
Fire does not stop at national borders , and so we have to have a European protocol on fire-fighting . We should at least consider the creation of a specific European agency and , of course , specialist cross-border units .
Mr. Commissioner , sometimes twenty-fours hours is too long .
Without taking anything away from the role that the European Solidarity Fund has , I believe that we would be wrong if we limited ourselves to the search for funds every time we suffer a fire .
It is necessary to beyond this : for example , the European Commission , with the support of the Council , has cancelled the aid to farmers for the creation , cleaning and surveillance of firewalls , something which we could perhaps reconsider .
Mr. President , these are some of the proposals that we could evaluate on this temporary commission that the PPE-DE Group is proposing be set up in our Chamber .
Mr. President , effectively - others have said this before myself - two natural phenomena in this summer of 2005 , the devastating fires and the violent floods , have caused destruction and tragic loss of human life in the whole of the European continent : in the Member States , in some candidate countries and also in our closest neighbours , such as Switzerland .
In its resolution , the Socialist Group would like to firstly pay sincere homage to these victims and to align itself with their families and with their friends .
In our Resolution , the socialists state that these disasters are not one isolated fact , but rather that they repeat themselves year after year . Their repetition demonstrates structural causes , amongst which we could find climate change , but also other associated ones , for example , agriculture and agrarian forms of use .
In its Resolution , the Socialist Group appeals for European solidarity , not only through an immediate economic commitment , asking the Commission to activate the Solidarity Fund , but also through other medium and long-term measures , such as the creation of a European civil protection unit or a European drought observatory or also , colleagues , through the preparation of an initiatives report .
We believe that this would be more effective than a temporary commission , and would seal the commitment that the European Parliament must also acquire . This is not just by urging other institutions , such as the European Commission , to work , but it also has to work itself as a legislator , in this case through its different committees , that could put together a common task which , as I say , would be summarised in an initiatives report on forest fires and on the natural disasters that periodically rock our continent in summer .
Of course , colleagues , the European drought observatory would be the tool that could assist with the knowledge , reduction and monitoring of the effects of drought in Europe .
Mr. President , I am grateful to Mr. Weber for his willingness to find a dialogue and his search for agreements .
I honestly that democracy is a system based on public opinion and that therefore , its quality depends on the quality of what we have come to call freedom of expression , which is a right that not everybody understands properly .
For me , freedom of expression is , above all , the right of every citizen to select the informative channels that he prefers .
Therefore , in order to safeguard this right , it is necessary to avoid many resources being in a few hands , and I completely agree with you , Mr. Weber , on the need to combat the phenomenon of concentration . But it is also necessary to consolidate the situation of not subjecting the mass media to the criteria that may be capriciously decided on by the political power of the moment .
Colleagues , these considerations are very general from my point of view , and we can extract some specific points from them , that I would like to become true in the not too distant future .
It is necessary to combat all of those initiatives that take quality out of the freedom of expression . It is therefore not acceptable to try to interfere in programme content .
Let us refrain from doing this .
In my opinion , we should not tell commercial television how to run the advertising on their channels , because advertising is fundamental for commercial television companies .
They have to respect the limit that the law sets , but we should not tell them how they have to distribute it , because they know perfectly well how to make the engine of their commercial survival profitable .
Mr. Weber , it is necessary to set out the political goal - and here is where we disagree - of ending with a concept that seems perverse to me : that of public service .
This concept makes sense insofar as the radio-electric space is limited and , therefore , governments have to regulate it by means of a set of administrative concessions which , in the end , end up by being intimidatory .
But , Mr. Weber , you have acknowledged that we are heading towards a world in which television has to be re-defined , in which television is the conventional television that we know , but it is also television by Internet , television by mobile telephone and television by all of the new technologies .
It is thus not a scarce resource , and we have to restrict the State 's interference .
I would like this public service concept not to be attributed to allocated to commercial television in the not too distant future .
And , accordingly , I would like us to reach agreement when it comes to re-defining the role pf public television companies , which are fundamental , always having regard to the principle of subsidiarity . That is to say , making those programmes that viewers want to watch and that they can not watch on commercial television .
Mr. Weber , this is the principle of subsidiarity , which I defend .
In short , and to conclude Mr. President , I believe that technologies are changing and that therefore this effectively changes perspectives . It is our responsibility to use this to its base so that the new " Television without borders " Directive can be an opportunity to increase the quality of democracy .
This is why I express my desire that this goes well for us .
Mr. President , I would firstly like to express my congratulations for the review of this Directive , because it updates some provisions from the 束 Television without borders 損 Directive , specifically those that refer to the promotion of the distribution and of the production of television programmes .
The market can not resolve the problems of the sector by itself in terms of television content and , besides , technological progress should not be left out of the existing regulation .
This is why it is necessary for the set of articles of the Directive to be periodically reviewed , so as to prevent technological development becoming a symptom of a lack of control and ensuring the maintenance of the fundamental principles of the current Directive - amongst which , I would like to highlight the protection of minors and the control of violence .
Given the recording of the fact that the market shares of European works are largely covered by national works , I fully support the speaker in the defence of the voluntary initiatives for increasing market shares for non-national European works and support the proposal for setting up more effective mechanisms for the respect and control of the legislation of Member States .
Taking account of the fact that audio-visual public services are key in the formation of public opinion , that they contribute towards cultural diversity and pluralism and help to create awareness amongst European citizens , I would like to highlight the importance of learning languages so as to have greater access to pan-European audio-visual works and channels .
I would also like to say that the revised Directive must safeguard the development of new technologies and the new services , in order to guarantee the growth of the European economy and the creation of employment , in accordance with the Lisbon strategy .
Finally , it is necessary to ensure that there is pluralism of the media , avoiding the warding of licences that infringe the law , together with concentration , which entails a threat for democracy .
Cultural diversity , liberty and the pluralism of the mass media must continue being the most important elements of the European audio-visual model .
In accordance with the agenda , we shall now debate the declarations of the Council and the Commission on freedom and security : responses to the terrorist threat while safeguarding the rights of the people .
Mr. President , to define and specify what must be the political role of the European Union and its institutions in the fight against terrorism constitutes , in my opinion , an absolutely undelayable objective in this Presidency of the European Union .
This which I am saying is not driven by a Europeanist reasoning , but rather fundamentally constitutes a need for each of the nations that suffers from the terrorist phenomenon .
This is a need in order for the profound sense of the Union to emerge , it is a need for all of us , for all Europeans , and it is a need because , if the European Union is unable to play a role in the fight against terrorism , the question ' what is the European Union good for ? ' will arise .
If to face the fear there is no union , and that is the European Union , then what is the European Union good for ?
And , obviously , that will mean not only a failure for the European Union , but also waste by the European nations , which will be unable to use the value of the Union to fight a phenomenon like that of terrorism .
The European Union must be an essential political element to fight against terrorism , especially for the Ministers of the Interior .
I already know that these Ministers have a lot of emergencies , they have a need for a lot of instruments and tools , but I believe that one of the main emergencies in this European Council which you all have before you is that you , the Ministers of the Interior and justice , must know how to promote a European political project and know how to find a utility and effectiveness to the European Union in order to fight terrorism , because it is you who are most going to need the Union in the upcoming years .
I am speaking of a political project of the European Union , not a thorough listing of measures which , in the end , we are unable to communicate .
It is clear that we must use the Union to favor measures on biometric data , to which Mr. Clarke made reference or , without a doubt , the withholding of information or , without a doubt , anything which the Ministers of the Interior require , but we must place the accent on the political dimension , on the dimension of a European political project .
In this Parliament , we dedicate a lot of time to talking about technical and legal measures , but very little about the political effort that the European Union requires in order to fight terrorism .
We can not continue to build the house from the roof down ; we must give the indispensable political dimension to the European Union 's action .
And where can we find the European political project ?
I am trying to say that , given Islamic terrorism , the terrorism of those who say they defend Islam , the terrorism of Al Qaeda , the important thing is for us to understand that it is an emerging phenomenon that we know almost nothing about : the pace , the times , the manner in which they choose the nations where they will carry out terrorist attempts .
We do not know this .
We need a European political project based on information and on intelligence in order to know more about the phenomenon and diagnose the organization that we have before us .
We must be capable not only of implementing measures , but also for European people to know and understand what we are doing .
We do not dedicate any time or political effort to saying what we do , and the European people do not know what the European Union does .
