The President .
I declare the session of the European Parliament once again open , after being interrupted on Thursday , 28 October , 2004 .
The President .
Early November brings back the memory of events in our history that Europeans should never forget because , in a sense , they are linked to situations through which we are currently living .
A week ago , on 9 November , we celebrated the fifteenth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall and with it the demise of the Soviet empire , which led to the unification of the Continent within the European Union .
Today , therefore , we are celebrating this anniversary for the first time here together in the Parliament of all Europeans .
The fall of the Berlin wall was the last geopolitical event derived from the First World War .
On 11 November , we also celebrated the armistice that ended that drama , that great civil war between Europeans .
On the 9 we likewise celebrated the International Day against Fascism and Anti-Semitism in memory of the night when institutionalised persecution of a people for racial reasons commenced .
Honourable Members , we can not relax in the defence of human rights for which the European Union has fought so hard .
Although it does not appear to be so , they are always in danger .
Our peace , peace between Europeans that we celebrate so happily , has been threatened recently by new perils that menace our values and our lives together .
I believe I can say in the name of all , that it is with sadness and worry that we are following events in the Netherlands at this time : this escalation of tension and ethnic-religious confrontation .
I think this is a good moment to send a message of solidarity to the Dutch government and the whole of Dutch society , whatever their origins or beliefs .
Likewise , our hearts go out fully to those who through their sense of personal responsibility have committed themselves to avoid promoting a useless spiral of violence .
The European Parliament is conscious that extremism and xenophobia , from wherever they arise , do not represent , at the end of the day , more than a tiny part of the population of this country and that they will not be able , under any circumstances , to cast a shadow over Dutch society , one of the most tolerant and integrated societies in Europe .
As well as this , recently Yasser Arafat , President of the Palestinian Legislative Council passed away and this Council sent a letter of condolence .
Our Honourable Vice-President , Mr McMillan-Scott , represented the Council at the funeral held in Cairo last Friday .
For 40 years , Mr Arafat was a symbol of the struggle of his people to gain self-determination .
Today , his disappearance offers a new opportunity to hope for peace between Israeli and Palestinian peoples .
I would like to reiterate the words of Javier Solana who , speaking in the name of the Council , declared that the Union must be prepared to participate in a new round of peace talks if they are re-launched .
I am sure that all Europeans would like to take advantage of this occurrence to urge the effective application of the Roadmap .
( Applause )
The President .
That is a good question that can be put to the Honourable Mr Balkenende ; it is worthwhile asking the Council President-in-Office , who has called us together .
I believe it is the fashion that , at the end of each Presidency , the Council President-in-Office appears before Parliament and summarises his Presidency .
If we do not do so now , we will have to do it in late January , and this would interfere with the dynamic of the next Presidency .
The Honourable Mr Balkenende was ready to appear before us on 21 , very close to the festive season , and I do not think it would have been very courteous on our behalf to tell him that we have had second thoughts and do not want him to come .
I hope that the meeting on 21 is sufficiently useful and interesting to justify the work and the cost of calling it .
López-Istúriz White ( PPE.D.E ) . - ( ES )
Honourable Mr President , I want to call the attention of this Assembly to the behind-the-scenes manoeuvres of the Spanish and British governments , who are supplying a breath of fresh air to the bloody communist regime of Fidel Castro in Cuba .
Sir , you reminded us that the Berlin wall has fallen , yet , unfortunately , fossilised assassins continue to threaten our ideals of democracy and liberty .
That is Castro 's regime .
I am following your advice , Honourable Mr President , not lowering my guard in the defence of human rights , and I ask you not to allow other honourable Members of this Parliament to travel to Cuba again , providing publicity for the regime , paid for out of our budget , but rather to support future trips to Cuba by Members who can illuminate and inform us about the situation of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba .
The policy of the European Union regarding Cuba must not change .
We must defend this in memory of the thousands of people tortured and assassinated , specifically bearing in mind what occurred last year with the summary execution of several innocent people .
No more political prisoners in Cuba .
We request the liberty of the Cuban people to achieve a pacific political transition to demonstrate their openness of mind .
The Cuban people do not need out-of-date clowns or accomplices to prop up the regime and pat it on the back .
Romeva i Rueda ( Greens / ALE ) , rapporteur . - ( ES )
Mister President , I would like to thank once more , both Mister Nicolaï and Mister Patten , not only for their presence here but also for the clarity and frankness with which they have spoken , and with which I hope we 'll be able to begin discussions later .
In effect , in this Parliament , we frequently protest about the violation of human rights in different parts of the world and we just as frequently adopt resolutions to condemn these acts .
We have condemned assassinations , torture , abuse and wars , while we permanently condemn the extreme poverty that exists in the world and which thousands of nations and millions of people suffer .
Meanwhile , our Governments continue to authorize arms exports , which not only contributes to worsening the conditions of these people but , moreover , it encourages the purchasers to spend enormous sums of money for military purposes , when the social priorities and development of their countries specifically demand prioritising other ends .
In the year 2000 , 189 countries signed the Millennium Declaration in New York , making the commitment , from 2015 to 2050 , to end poverty , guarantee universal access to essential medicines and ensure equal opportunities between men and women , as well as combating illiteracy and universalising primary schooling , among many other questions .
To achieve these ends , it is necessary for governments to annually earmark at least 60 billion dollars to applying the aforesaid Millennium Agenda .
However , in spite of the fact that it is extremely difficult to raise money for these ends , world military spending in the 2002-2003 period grew by 64 billion dollars and in the 2003-2004 period 50 billion dollars more had to be added to that .
European Union countries , responsible for a third of conventional weapons exports worldwide , have in this sense an important responsibility .
In 2002 , referred to , in fact , in the report we are currently discussing , the European Union sold arms and military equipment to the value of 21 billion euros in countries such as Saudi Arabia , Morocco , India , Pakistan , Angola , Turkey , Iran , Algeria , Columbia , Israel and even Iraq , among many other destinations that , according to a strict interpretation of the European Union Code of Conduct , should not be listed among purchasers of European weapons .
Where is the problem ?
As has been mentioned , the problem resides , on one hand , in that this Code is too vague and , on the other , that it is still not a legally binding instrument , which is why its violation does not carry criminal penalties .
The European Parliament has always been the leading European institution to demand that European weapons exports are governed by a strict Code of Conduct and , likewise , that these exports are coherent with the constant messages we send out from the European Union in favour of preventing armed conflict and promoting peace and development .
For this reason , after ten years of professional dedication to this area , I must congratulate the Dutch Presidency in particular for the effort it is making , not only regarding revision of the Code of Conduct but also to ensure it is a much more valiant , coherent and , in short , efficient text .
Yet it still does not go far enough and , for that reason , we should remember - as we do in the report - that it is necessary to reiterate the need for reviewing the text of the Code , to make it stricter , and demand that it become a legally binding instrument . Although we still do not have consensus , we must work to achieve it , demand that Governments increase the clarity of their actions and improve the information they provide regarding the authorisation and rejection of permits , demand that the Code is also applied to the export of material that can be used for torture or to apply the death penalty , demand that the European Union equips itself with instruments allowing it to improve records held on arms intermediaries , whether they work from the European Union , or whether they are merely registered there , that they fall into line regarding increasingly strict legislation on the control of exports .
Finally , among many other things , the report demands that the European Union becomes co-leader on an international scale in adopting an international arms treaty .
Lastly , given that this debate is taking place at a time when certain European governments are proposing the need to raise the arms embargo on China , it is pertinent to use this opportunity , once again , to reiterate how inopportune it is to raise that embargo .
There are at least three reasons for this : the clearly unsatisfactory situation of human rights in that country , often denounced by NGOs ; the fact that , since China is the main conventional weapons importer in the world , to increase the military market there would certainly lead to an acceleration of the arms race in that region ; lastly , there are numerous risks that certain unresolved conflicts could worsen , such as the conflict between China and Taiwan or the pressure being applied - not yet clarified - on Tibet .
For all these reasons , I appeal to the Council not only to listen but to take into consideration and show respect for the proposals and recommendations made by this Assembly , with the objective of eliminating for once and for all the flagrant contradiction it signifies : to lament , on the one hand , poverty , wars and human rights violations in the world , while on the other , we contribute to feeding the flames in multiple conflict zones with our weapons and our silence , which is incomprehensible to millions of victims .

Van Orden ( PPE.D.E ) . - ( EN )
Mister President , the British Conservatives believe that the Code of Conduct on weapons exports has worked well as a politically binding instrument since its creation in 1998 , yet it can still be improved and perfected .
However , we oppose the Code becoming a legally binding instrument .
We believe that in many cases delicate political decisions must be made and the people best suited to making them are Ministries holding political responsibility , not judges .
A portion of the information on which decisions are based is highly sensitive and confidential , and must remain under the government 's control .
Naturally , we do not want the European Court of Justice to intervene in this area either .
In any case , a legally binding embargo does not signify more than another opportunity for certain States to make a show of their hypocrisy , such as we have already seen , for example , in the efforts of some to evade the specific sanctions imposed by the European Union against the regimes of Zimbabwe and Myanmar , or even the efforts that certain States make to evade sanctions imposed by the United Nations against the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq .
If we read the Romeva i Rueda report , some of the recommendations it contains would simply be counterproductive were they to be adopted .
For example , it proposes publishing information on the number of permits rejected , stating the reason for their rejection .
Publishing information on the permits rejected will allow some unscrupulous arms manufacturers and arms dealers to know who requires what product or , what virtually amounts to the same thing , gain access to a customer list for despicable traders .
In the United Kingdom we have sufficient laws , yet we want to encourage other States to reach our high levels .
You can be sure that any new law that the European Union adopts will be respected and applied rigorously in Great Britain , but ignored in other countries .
In Europe we devote a lot of time to keeping a watch on ourselves , but the main problems are in unscrupulous countries that do not respect international law .
The President .
In accordance with the agenda , we will proceed with the debate about the Report by the European Council and the Declaration of the Commission related to Meeting of the European Council held in Brussels on 4 and 5 November 2004 .
Balkenende , President-in-Office of the Council . ( NL )
Mister President , Honourable Members , I am pleased to have the opportunity of informing you about the meeting of the European Council held on 4 and 5 November , which was a productive encounter .
The meeting revolved around subjects of fundamental importance for the public , such as the economy , the area of freedom , security and justice .
Likewise , we debated the subject " Communicating Europe " , related to improving communication and the interaction between politicians and citizens from all over Europe .
Lastly , we tackled various matters regarding current foreign affairs , including Iraq .
The recent events that have occurred in my country force me to talk firstly of the subject of freedom , security and justice .
These events have unpleasantly but conclusively shown that cooperation in these areas needs to be boosted .
I am very grateful , Mister President , for your words of support and solidarity that you addressed to the Dutch Government on 15 November and to the whole of the community in my country .
Allow me to reply to these words as a Dutchman .
The Netherlands is proud of its diversity .
Since the Second World War , our doors have been wide open to large groups of people from different countries ; some came fleeing persecution , others because they could find a better future among us and they were a welcome reinforcement to our labour market .
The contribution of these people to our society has been huge and is welcome .
At present , they and their families form part of us , and this " belonging " requires thought and effort on both sides .
Integration is a complex matter in which identities , norms and values merge , as well as mutual comprehension and understanding .
At the same time , integration demands respect and the fulfilment of the fundamental rules in our society : freedom of opinion , religious freedom and respect for a democratic Rule of Law , which should offer individuals the protection to which they have a right .
The last time I was lucky enough to intervene in this Parliament , I said , in relation to the prospect of Turkey 's accession to the Union , that Islam or religion were not the problem , and I wish to repeat that today .
In our European society , people with different beliefs are perfectly able to coexist or live together .
What is not acceptable is to use religion as an excuse to attack citizens , schools , mosques or churches , and we must all fight against this , all over Europe , with conviction and determination .
Mister President , in your words of support last Monday you underlined the importance behind the recent events that occurred in the Netherlands for the whole of society in Europe , and I agree with you .
The Netherlands is convinced that we must cooperate much more efficiently in the fight against terrorism .
The wave of violent reactions and counter reactions after Mister Van Gogh 's assassination one again made it clear that tensions exist in the structure of our society .
In Europe we must also learn from each other insofar as the integration of minorities is concerned .
I will now go on to examine in greater detail the multiannual programme for Justice and Home Affairs , the Hague Programme , which anticipates a more in-depth analysis of both of these areas .
Last week a ministerial conference was held in which the matter of integration was discussed at length and in which , of course , existing operative instruments were applied .
On the other hand , the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs have requested that the events in the Netherlands be tackled and that they be deliberated in conjunction with the European aspects that they involve , at the Council of Justice and Home Affairs next Friday .
I will now act as President-in-Office of the European Council and return to the subject of this debate .
