PRESIDENCY OF MR ONYSZKIEWICZVice-President
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting ( See Minutes )
2005 budget procedure
The President .
In accordance with the agenda , the proceedings for joint debate of two reports on behalf of the Committee on Budgets about the draft general budget for 2005 were initiated .
Firstly , the report ( A 6 - 0021/2004 ) by Mr Garriga Polledo about the draft general budget for 2005 ( Section III ) ;
Followed by the report ( A 6 - 0020/2004 ) by Mrs Elisabet Jensen about the draft budget for the 2005 draft general budget ( Sections I , II , IV , V , VI , VII and VIII ) .
The list of speakers to debate these matters is very long , I would therefore invite the rapporteur , Mr Garriga Polledo , to take the floor .
Garriga Polledo ( PPE.D.E ) , rapporteur .
- ( ES ) Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , fellow colleagues , it was stated in September 's Plenary that we would receive a draft budget from the Council that would deal with accountancy rather than political issues .
On Thursday , here , in Parliament , we will vote on a clearly political budget .
Political because it reflects the political priorities that parliamentary groups and the Members used when they stood for election on 13 June .
And we would do well to remember that Parliament - the Members of this House - , and not the Council stood for election .
All the Members of this House entered into an agreement with the voters , an agreement that includes defending and promoting measures that , I hope , will be reflected in this draft budget that I am putting forward for your approval .
It is also political because it reflects one of the Council 's usual strategies , which is to finance its own priorities rather than Parliament 's priorities .
In other words , when we vote next Thursday we will try to balance the inter-institutional scales , a balance without which the European Union can not be properly run .
Mr President , I would like to say a few words to the Commissioner , who is leaving the European Commission today .
A Commissioner for Budgets is always in the difficult position between the Parliament and the Council - two budgetary authorities forced to agree with each other although , on certain occasions , it seems that they are far from agreeing with each other- .
The Commissioner is largely responsible for the budgetary peace in the last few years , and I would therefore like to say that thanks to the last-minute agreements drawn up by the Commissioner and her team , we have been able to overcome complex situations .
I hope that her new life , far from Brussels , will be just as successful as over the past few years .
In any case , I would like to say that for all those involved in the budget it has been a pleasure working with you .
The former Commissioner 's virtues of patience and negotiation are going to be needed - and let us hope that her successor possesses them- with this first reading of the European Parliament , because it is vastly different from the Council 's first reading .
As rapporteur and a long-standing member of the Committee on Budgets for the past ten years , I know perfectly well how to distinguish between the limits of what can be demanded and political reality .
But from the outset there are certain positions that this House can not renounce .
A realistic approach is for the European Parliament to defend its priorities in these very difficult and limited circumstances .
We accept the general lines of the Commission 's preliminary draft budget , modified by the competent commissions , political groups and individual Members that have suggested amendments .
As you already know , a technical adjustment has been made to the maximum limits of headings 3 , 4 and 5 , which in themselves create insurmountable difficulties in reaching the 2004 budget figures .
The Honourable Member Mulder - rapporteur for the 2004 budget- had a brilliant financial year .
I too hope to do the same this year , although I know that , in any case , I have less financial resources available to me than last year .
The Council has cut internal policies by 55 million euros with regard to the preliminary draft budget , creating an impossible margin of 108 million euros .
The amendments that you - the Honourable Members of the House- have put forward for this draft budget , just under heading 3 , would imply over 350 million euros .
And each and every one of these amendments is perfectly justified .
The Council has cut external policies by 129 million euros in relation to the Committee 's preliminary draft budget , leaving a margin of 14 million , when the negative margin that resulted in committee was 115 million euros and that already posed a serious threat to Parliament 's traditional external priorities .
The amendments to heading 4 entail over 400 million euros , and this rapporteur must take them into consideration , partly because they are a fundamental reflection of the wishes expressed by two important parliamentary committees : The Committee on Development and the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
In heading 5 - that in theory might seem where an agreement would more easily be made- , the Council alone made cuts that put administrative expenditure for the Committee and other institutions one and a half points below what had been foreseen in the Committee 's draft and it is very difficult - as the Commissioner well knows- to uphold an administrative budget that is calculated down to the very last cent , when other institutions come along and reduce it .
Thankfully , the Committee - and once again I must congratulate the Commissioner- has managed to make an extra effort to make savings without becoming less efficient .
In any case , I would like to say that the European Parliament wishes to reinstate the administrative expenditure registered in the preliminary draft budget .
Faced with these circumstances , we have had to establish a set of priorities .
Which are :
Firstly , the Lisbon strategy and its policies for growth and job creation , because they appear in practically all the political programmes that the Honourable Members employed to stand for these elections .
At a time of difficult and weak economic growth within the European Union , it would be suicide not to strengthen the very policies whose goal is the growth , development and creation of jobs .
Therefore , we have approved amendments that increase these lines found in the Lisbon strategy by 80 million .
Secondly , in communications strategy , because , above all , of the high rate of abstention in the European elections , because we expanded our borders and the idea of the Union must be explained to the new citizens much better , and because we are having a constitutional debate on the future of the European Union , this is another of Parliament 's priorities and that is why we have presented an amendment to the value of 24 million euros .
Thirdly , reinforcing security , the fight against terrorism and consolidating a European strategy in matters of immigration and asylum .
I think you all have this priority and it is not necessary to explain , unfortunately , why it should be a priority for Parliament and the European Union in 2005 .
Fourthly , another basic priority is the consolidation of the European Union 's external action , with particular emphasis on the fight against disease and poverty and the attention given to geographical areas .
Here we are subject to the principle that the European Union 's external commitments can not be obtained at the expense of Parliament 's traditional priorities , or what amounts to the same thing , new commitments , new resources .
Fifthly , we want a very serious debate with the Council about the funding of decentralised Agencies , which I will analyse later on .
I would like to highlight the support given to political Groups when rendering these priorities as budgetary amendments .
The other coordinators have offered me nothing less than their support , positive suggestions and backing .
They have all sacrificed other priorities ; they have all had to give complex explanations to their colleagues about the decisions made .
And this is a message that I would like - both the Commission and the Council - to receive loud and clear : this first reading expresses a clear and unequivocal commitment for November 's negotiations .
We are not going to approve a second reading that discards our priorities unilaterally .
If sacrifices are to be made , each and every institution will have to make them .
Let us now go over the reading by headings , bearing in mind that the European Parliament is going to cast an overall vote next Thursday and that , as such , for negotiation purposes , it will be subject to three-way dialogues and conciliation .
In heading 1 - Agriculture - we approved 50 799 million euros in commitment appropriations .
Our point of reference was the preliminary draft budget put forward by the Committee , although we are still pending the reception of the appropriations needed to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria .
In subheading 1 b ) we have a political priority expressed by the Committee on Budgets and that , as such , will come up for approval next Thursday .
In accordance with which , we will raise the sum of 57 million euros over and above the ceiling in subheading 1 b ) , the item that will be allocated to the establishment and training of young farmers .
We have also increased appropriations for measures to eradicate animal diseases and to favour food safety , as these are also priorities for Parliament .
In heading 2 we are going to approve 42 378 million euros in commitment appropriations .
In this category payments are fundamental , the category in which the amendments we put forward for payments have the greatest impact .
In order to avoid and absorb RALs , which , Honourable Members , have now risen to 122 000 million euros - and which are needed for a financial year - we have increased the preliminary draft budget in the lines in which RALs double their annual commitment .
In the remaining lines we support the demand for payment that the Committee has made and that we hope the Council will take into consideration .
Therefore , we request that the payments made to us be increased to 3 800 million euros .
In heading 3 - internal Policies - , we approved 9 012 million euros , we left a zero margin and we approved an amendment with asterisk .
In any case - besides the horizontal amendments traditionally made for performance facilities and for improved implementation - , our fundamental aim in this heading is to talk very seriously with the Council about funding for Agencies .
As the Honourable Members might be aware , between 2000 and 2005 the number of decentralised Agencies - that was one of this Parliament 's ideas , and I remember the budget procedure in which it was adopted - rose from 7 to 23 .
The increase in budget for Agencies has risen from 96 to 281 million euros and for the next budget in 2005 we expect a 20 % increase .
The number of posts assigned to Agencies has risen from 418 in 2000 to 2695 .
All in all , this has implied a reduction in the heading 's ceiling of about 134 million euros for the funding of the remaining priorities .
As rapporteur I can not accept this situation and what I suggest to the Council is that we enter into serious negotiations .
In order for negotiations to take place with this Parliament 's rapporteur for the Agencies - Mrs Haug - , we have put forward an amendment that affects all of the Agencies and that will mean a reduction of 40 million euros , resulting in a budget for the latter on the same level as the budget for 2004 .
Our intention in this case is , firstly , to point out that the funding for any kind of increase that the Council hopes to obtain with newly established Agencies must be debated with this Parliament . This is because the financial restraints by which we are bound , with the financial perspectives for the 2002-2006 period , means that at this stage this annual increase for Agencies must be done at the expense of Parliament 's priorities , and Parliament has more political priorities than the Agencies , although the Agencies are , of course , something that need to be funded and we also have a commitment to that end .
I would like to discuss pilot projects .
We have already agreed upon an acceptable package with the Political Groups .
Some of them are of great interest , such as the one for small and medium-sized enterprises , the pilot project against terrorism , the one for the reduction of nuclear weapons and the one for conflict prevention .
I believe that we have devised a wide-ranging and ambitious package .
Likewise , among the preparatory actions I would like to point out the parliamentary agreement for the voluntary return of immigrants , to help in the fight against poverty related diseases - to which we have assigned 10 million euros , which I believe constitutes a significant contribution to funding - and , similarly , the new strategy we have pursued to redirect certain pilot projects to educational matters .
Finally , in heading 4 we have approved 5 119 million euros - plus an amendment with asterisk .
What is basically happening in heading 4 is that we once again find ourselves having to provide funding for Iraq .
This funding was not anticipated for 2005 and what has been tabled is that we provide funds at the cost of Parliament 's traditional priorities , such as the external policies approved by Parliament this year , last year and in 2000 .
This is unacceptable .
Therefore , taking heed of what the Committee on Development and the Committee on Foreign Affairs suggested , we have sought funding for this heading from the newly assigned resources in the Inter-institutional Agreement to the value of 190 million euros .
At the same time , we also question - or include in the same package - the common foreign and security policy , which is extremely important for this parliament , but whose funding should be contemplated within the general framework of what needs to be funded in heading 4 .
Mr President , we have tabled a motion that I hope will be approved by a broad majority of our fellow Members next Thursday and that this will mean a strong negotiating position vis-à-vis the Council , because , I repeat , what we are taking into consideration are the political policies this Parliament has set itself .
( Applause )
Jensen ( ALDE ) , rapporteur .
- ( DA ) Mr President , Honourable Minister , Commissioner , I would like to begin by thanking Commissioner Schreyer , who is today giving her last budget reading and , just like Mr Garriga , I am sorry that this should be .
I recall the relations that existed between Parliament and the Commission in budget matters when you took up your post , just over five years ago .
When one entered the Commission 's meeting room to talk about budgetary matters , a coldness could be felt in the atmosphere , because relations were not at all good after the fall of the Santer Committee .
There was a great deal of mistrust between the Commission and Parliament and very hard things were said .
I think that Mrs Schreyer has made an enormous contribution to re-establish the trust between Parliament and the Commission through the way she works and the way she does things .
For that I am truly grateful .
I really do believe that extraordinary achievements have been reached over the last five years .
I must say something about the budgets of the remaining institutions .
Together , Mr Garriga and I decided to follow a strategy to endeavour to find the greatest quantity of funds within expenditure heading five , in such a way that we would be able to return most of the savings agreed upon by the Council and thus fulfil our wish to increase staff as a result of the enlargement , the staff reform and the changes in the management of funds .
If we analyse the budgets of the Court of Justice , the Court of Auditors , the European Economic and Social Committee , the Committee for Regions , the Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor , the budget we are putting forward now , and which has been passed by the Committee on Budgets , is 10 million euros more than the Council 's preliminary draft project .
We have thus returned almost two thirds of the Council 's savings , and this in practice makes it possible for all the institutions to increase their staff as a result of the enlargement , and of the staff and financial management reforms .
I am pleased that , thanks to the dialogue with the institutions , a valid solution has been found that satisfies everyone , or at least I hope this is so , and I wish to thank you for your constructive work in this process .
